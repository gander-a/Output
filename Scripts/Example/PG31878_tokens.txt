thou
art
my

splintering
with

by
thee
on
the
grey
forest
floor
beside
thee
my
lady
lady
of
rivers
strewn
with
stones
only
thou
art
my
lady
where
thousand
the
freshets
are
crowded
like
peasants
to
a
fair
clear
skinned
wild
from
seclusion
they
jostle
white
armed
down
the
thoroughfare
praising
my
lady
homage
elvira
by
love
grace
there
goeth
before
you
a
clear
radiance
which
maketh
all
vain
souls
candles
when
noon
is
the
loud
clangour
of
pretenders
melteth
before
you
like
the
roll
of
carts
passing
but
you
come
silently
and
homage
is
given
now
the
little
which
leadeth
to
love
is
again
joyful
with
its
many
and
the
great
highway
from
love
is
without
passers

broken
in
upon
me
apollo
through
a
splendour
of
purple
garments
held
by
the
clym√®ne
to
clothe
the
white
of
thy
shoulders
bare
from
the
day
leaping
of
horses
this
is
strange
to
me
here
in
the
modern
twilight
crude
lament
mother
of
flames
the
men
that
went
ahunting
are
asleep
in
the
snow
drifts
you
have
kept
the
fire
burning
crooked
fingers
that
pull
fuel
from
among
the
wet
leaves
mother
of
flames
you
have
kept
the
fire
burning
the
young
wives
have
fallen
asleep
with
wet
hair
weeping
mother
of
flames
the
young
men
raised
the
heavy
spears
and
are
gone
prowling
in
the
darkness
o
mother
of
flames
you
who
have
kept
the
fire
burning
lo
i
am
helpless
would
god
they
had
taken
me
with
them
the
ordeal
o
crimson
salamander
because
of
love
whim
sacred
swim
the
winding
flame
predestined
to
disman
him
and
bring
our
fellow
home
to
us
again
swim
in
with
watery
fang
gnaw
out
and
drown
the
fire
roots
that
circle
him
until
the
dies
down
and
he
comes
home
again
aye
bring
him
home
o
crimson
salamander
that
i
may
see
he
is
unchanged
with
burning
then
have
your
will
with
him
o
crimson
salamander
the
death
of
franco
of
cologne
his
prophecy
of
beethoven
it
is
useless
good
woman
useless
the
spark
fails
me
god
yet
when
the
might
of
it
all
assails
me
it
seems
impossible
that
i
can
not
do
it
yet
i
can
not
they
were
right
and
they
all
knew
it
years
ago
but
i
never
i
have
persisted
blindly
they
say
and
now
i
am
old
i
have
resisted
everything
but
now
now
the
strife
ended
the
fire
out
the
old
cloak
has
been
mended
for
the
last
time
the
soul
peers
through
its
tatters
put
a
light
by
and
leave
me
nothing
more
matters
now
i
am
done
i
am
at
last
well
broken
yet
by
god
i
still
leave
them
a
token
that
they
swear
it
was
no
dead
man
writ
it
a
morsel
that
they
mark
well
the
day
they
bit
it
that
there
be
sand
between
their
gross
teeth
to
crunch
yet
when
goodman
gabriel
blows
his
concluding
trumpet
leave
me
and
now
little
black
eyes
come
you
out
here
ah
you
given
me
a
lively
lasting
bout
year
after
year
to
win
you
round
me
darlings
precious
children
little
gambollers
farlings
they
might
have
called
you
once
nearlings
i
call
you
now
i
first
of
all
the
yearlings
upon
this
plain
for
i
it
was
that
tore
you
out
of
chaos
it
was
i
bore
you
ah
you
little
children
that
go
playing
over
the
gate
and
will
still
be
straying
spite
of
all
that
i
have
ever
told
you
of
counterpoint
and
cadence
which
does
not
hold
you
no
more
than
chains
will
for
this
or
that
strange
reason
but
you
always
at
some
new
loving
treason
to
be
away
from
me
laughing
mocking
witlessly
perhaps
but
for
all
that
forever
knocking
at
this
stanchion
door
of
your
poor
father
heart
till
oh
well
at
least
you
shown
that
you
can
grow
well
however
much
you
evade
me
faster
faster
but
black
eyes
some
day
you
get
a
master
for
he
will
come
he
shall
he
must
come
and
when
he
finishes
and
the
burning
dust
from
his
wheels
settles
what
shall
men
see
then
you
you
you
my
own
lovely
children
aye
all
of
you
thus
with
hands
together
playing
on
the
hill
or
there
in
a
tether
or
running
free
but
all
mine
aye
my
very
namesakes
shall
be
his
proper
fame
stakes
and
he
shall
lead
you
and
he
shall
meed
you
and
he
shall
build
you
gold
palaces
and
he
shall
wine
you
from
clear
chalices
for
i
have
seen
it
i
have
seen
it
written
where
the
screen
it
from
other
eyes
over
the
bronze
gates
of
paradise
portent
red
cradle
of
the
night
in
you
the
dusky
child
sleeps
fast
till
his
might
shall
be
piled
sinew
on
sinew
red
cradle
of
the
night
the
dusky
child
sleeping
sits
upright
lo
how
the
winds
blow
now
he
pillows
back
the
winds
are
again
mild
when
he
stretches
his
arms
out
red
cradle
of
the
night
the
alarms
shout
from
bare
tree
to
tree
wild
in
afright
mighty
shall
he
be
red
cradle
of
the
night
the
dusky
child
con
brio
miserly
is
the
best
description
of
that
poor
fool
who
holds
lancelot
to
have
been
a
morose
fellow
dolefully
brooding
over
the
events
which
had
naturally
to
follow
the
high
time
of
his
deed
with
guinevere
he
has
a
sick
historical
sight
if
i
judge
rightly
to
believe
any
such
thing
as
that
ever
occurred
but
by
the
god
of
blood
what
else
is
it
that
has
deterred
us
all
from
an
out
and
out
defiance
of
fear
but
this
same
perdamnable
miserliness
which
cries
about
our
necks
how
we
shall
have
less
and
less
than
we
have
now
if
we
spend
too
wantonly
bah
this
sort
of
slither
is
below
contempt
in
the
same
vein
we
should
have
apple
trees
exempt
from
bearing
anything
but
pink
blossoms
all
the
year
fixed
permanent
lest
their
bellies
wax
unseemly
and
the
dear
innocent
days
of
them
be
wasted
quite
how
can
we
have
less
have
we
not
the
deed
lancelot
thought
little
spent
his
gold
and
rode
to
fight
mounted
if
god
was
willing
on
a
good
steed
ad
infinitum
still
i
bring
flowers
although
you
fling
them
at
my
feet
until
none
stays
that
is
not
struck
across
with
wounds
flowers
and
flowers
that
you
may
break
them
utterly
as
you
have
always
done
sure
happily
i
still
bring
flowers
flowers
knowing
how
all
are
crumpled
in
your
praise
and
may
not
live
to
speak
a
lesser
thing
translations
from
the
spanish
el
romancero
i
although
you
do
your
best
to
regard
me
with
an
air
seeming
offended
never
can
you
deny
when
all
ended
calm
eyes
that
you
regard
me
however
much
you
at
pains
to
offend
me
by
which
i
may
suffer
what
offence
is
there
can
make
up
for
the
great
good
he
finds
who
attains
you
for
though
with
mortal
fear
you
reward
me
until
my
sorry
sense
is
plenished
never
can
you
deny
when
all
ended
calm
eyes
that
you
did
regard
me
thinking
thus
to
dismay
me
you
beheld
me
with
disdain
but
instead
of
destroying
the
gain
in
fact
with
doubled
good
you
paid
me
for
though
you
show
them
how
hardly
they
keep
off
from
leniency
bended
never
can
you
deny
when
all
ended
calm
eyes
that
you
did
regard
me
ii
ah
little
green
eyes
ah
little
eyes
of
mine
ah
heaven
be
willing
that
you
think
of
me
somewise
the
day
of
departure
you
came
full
of
grieving
and
to
see
i
was
leaving
the
tears
to
start
sure
with
the
heavy
torture
of
sorrows
unbrightened
when
you
lie
down
at
night
and
when
there
to
you
dreams
rise
ah
heaven
be
willing
that
you
think
of
me
somewise
deep
is
my
assurance
of
you
little
green
eyes
that
in
truth
you
realise
something
of
my
durance
eyes
of
hope
fair
assurance
and
good
premonition
by
virtue
of
whose
condition
all
green
colours
i
prize
ah
heaven
be
willing
that
you
think
of
me
somewise
would
god
i
might
know
you
to
which
quarter
bended
and
why
comprehended
when
sighings
overflow
you
and
if
you
must
go
through
some
certain
despair
for
that
you
lose
his
care
who
was
faithful
always
ah
heaven
be
willing
that
you
think
of
me
these
days
through
never
a
moment
i
known
how
to
live
lest
all
my
thoughts
but
as
one
pressed
for
their
concernment
may
god
send
chastisement
if
in
this
i
belie
me

if
it

now

me
talking
of
the

broken
