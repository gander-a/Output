thoughts
religion
in
some
form
or
other
seems
to
have
been
observed
by
mankind
in
all
ages
and
all
parts
of
the
world
and
considered
as
the
most
noble
employment
of
the
most
divine
nature
and
producing
the
most
beneficial
effects
to
society
of
all
the
objects
that
ever
engaged
their
attention
although
from
casual
circumstances
and
interested
motives
of
individuals
there
are
as
many
modes
and
varieties
of
worship
as
languages
or
nations
on
the
face
of
the
earth
europeans
have
in
general
embraced
christianity
as
contained
in
the
bible
which
call
the
word
of
god
as
the
only
true
and
infallible
system
on
earth
and
which
only
can
lead
us
to
eternal
happiness
this
bible
we
have
been
taught
to
believe
is
holy
just
perfect
and
superior
to
the
human
understanding
so
sacred
that
to
doubt
or
disbelieve
it
would
entail
on
us
inevitable
misery
this
doctrine
being
instilled
into
children
by
their
nurses
and
enforced
by
terror
at
a
riper
age
has
long
been
assented
to
by
the
of
who
seldom
think
or
enquire
for
themselves
but
are
always
more
or
less
the
dupes
of
designing
men
but
the
times
are
now
changing
the
privilege
of
reasoning
and
believing
for
ourselves
begins
to
be
exercised
freedom
of
enquiry
abounds
and
the
natural
inherent
right
of
speaking
and
acting
according
to
the
dictates
of
our
own
conscience
without
injuring
society
is
happily
enjoyed
consequently
impositions
of
every
kind
superstitious
prejudices
and
the
long
worshipped
fabrics
of
civil
and
religious
tyranny
are
daily
growing
into
contempt
and
in
all
probability
will
soon
be
torn
from
their
foundations
and
consigned
to
that
infamous
oblivion
which
they
so
highly
merit
to
come
more
immediately
to
the
point
the
christian
religion
as
generally
practised
presents
itself
as
one
of
those
monuments
of
ignorance
and
credulity
which
the
wisdom
of
the
present
generation
is
probably
destined
to
overthrow
and
to
substitute
a
system
more
simple
more
pure
and
more
agreeable
to
the
dictates
of
reason
the
bible
upon
examination
we
shall
find
deficient
in
many
of
the
virtues
that
have
been
ascribed
to
it
as
a
human
composition
its
merits
have
been
greatly
it
is
exceeded
in
sentiment
invention
style
and
every
other
literary
qualification
the
obscurity
incredibility
and
obscenity
so
conspicuous
in
many
parts
of
it
would
justly
condemn
the
works
of
a
modern
writer
it
contains
a
mixture
of
inconsistency
and
contradiction
to
call
which
the
of
is
the
highest
pitch
of
extravagance
it
is
to
attribute
to
the
deity
that
which
any
person
of
common
sense
would
blush
to
confess
himself
the
author
of
how
are
the
rights
and
dignity
of
human
nature
insulted
degraded
and
trampled
upon
how
are
mankind
blinded
deceived
and
led
away
by
this
system
how
is
the
honour
and
character
of
the
almighty
affronted
by
the
absurd
and
impious
doctrines
it
contains
how
is
the
sacred
name
of
god
abused
and
prostituted
to
the
vilest
and
most
execrable
purposes
by
his
pretended
worshippers
and
all
for
one
simple
evident
end
to
gratify
the
pride
and
avarice
of
unprincipled
designing
men
but
something
more
than
declamation
is
necessary
to
support
these
assertions
i
shall
therefore
give
the
reasons
why
i
disbelieve
the
christian
system
and
all
the
arguments
advanced
in
its
favour
as
to
the
existing
proofs
of
the
divine
authority
of
the
bible
whether
internal
or
external
whether
the
evidence
we
feel
in
our
own
minds
on
examining
it
or
the
miracles
which
are
said
to
have
attended
its
propagation
they
are
of
no
avail
in
convincing
us
of
its
divine
origin
and
i
do
not
think
that
independent
of
the
prejudices
of
education
and
the
power
of
eloquence
there
ever
was
a
reasonable
thinking
man
who
felt
a
sufficient
internal
evidence
to
convince
him
of
the
reality
of
the
whole
of
its
doctrines
with
respect
to
the
public
proofs
exhibited
by
its
founders
we
find
them
no
stronger
than
those
in
favour
of
mahometanism
or
perhaps
any
other
system
mahomet
is
said
to
have
wrought
as
many
miracles
preached
as
good
doctrine
converted
ten
times
as
many
followers
and
was
far
more
successful
in
all
his
enterprizes
however
bold
or
difficult
than
jesus
christ
the
christians
say
the
mahometan
miracles
were
nothing
but
impostures
and
the
mahometans
say
with
as
much
authority
that
the
christian
miracles
were
the
same
if
the
gospel
system
was
so
clear
so
reasonable
and
so
powerful
as
its
advocates
assert
what
necessity
could
there
have
been
for
miracles
to
support
it
if
it
had
any
foundation
in
reason
and
nature
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
for
mystery
miracle
or
revelation
to
confirm
it
a
doctrine
that
is
reasonable
and
true
will
appear
so
to
every
unprejudiced
mind
without
the
aid
of
any
thing
supernatural
consequently
that
system
which
requires
miraculous
assistance
to
establish
it
and
can
not
be
proved
by
human
means
is
neither
reasonable
nor
true
supposing
the
bible
to
have
been
written
by
divine
inspiration
at
the
times
and
by
the
persons
mentioned
in
it
still
it
is
next
to
impossible
that
it
could
have
been
transmitted
down
to
the
present
time
pure
and
uncontaminated
even
if
there
had
been
but
one
nation
and
one
language
upon
earth
the
variety
of
translations
and
editions
it
has
passed
through
in
the
course
of
near
years
if
it
has
existed
so
long
which
i
am
inclined
to
disbelieve
of
many
parts
and
the
continual
improvements
and
alterations
in
human
language
during
that
period
amount
to
a
presumptive
proof
that
the
sense
has
been
unavoidably
mistaken
or
wilfully
perverted
a
confirmation
of
this
remark
is
open
to
all
let
any
one
take
the
trouble
of
comparing
different
copies
of
the
bible
printed
in
the
last
and
present
centuries
or
even
in
the
same
year
and
he
will
often
find
a
striking
disagreement
admitting
that
the
bible
contains
the
only
doctrine
by
which
we
can
obtain
salvation
and
everlasting
life
which
of
the
numberless
professions
that
have
sprung
out
of
it
are
we
to
embrace
one
sect
tells
us
that
there
is
no
salvation
out
of
the
pale
of
their
church
another
tells
us
that
unless
we
believe
and
practise
their
doctrines
we
shall
surely
be
damned
let
us
believe
therefore
in
whatever
particular
profession
we
may
we
shall
be
damned
according
to
the
principles
of
the
others
how
gracious
and
beneficent
is
the
christian
system
so
perfect
and
pure
that
it
creates
so
many
different
distinct
and
opposite
denominations
of
believers
all
of
them
right
infallibly
right
in
their
own
opinions
and
proving
their
doctrine
by
the
clear
authority
of
divine
revelation
many
as
an
excuse
for
countenancing
a
doctrine
which
they
confess
may
not
be
true
say
that
if
the
christian
religion
be
false
it
is
still
very
hurtful
to
attempt
to
overturn
it
as
we
have
no
better
guide
and
no
other
method
to
restrain
the
passions
and
regulate
the
conduct
of
mankind
as
it
is
the
most
perfect
and
beneficial
system
that
could
be
devised
to
determine
this
we
must
look
at
its
effects
that
doctrine
which
has
the
greatest
tendency
to
secure
our
present
and
future
happiness
is
the
best
it
proves
itself
to
be
so
that
the
christian
system
does
not
tend
to
make
us
happier
may
easily
be
shewn
by
tracing
its
natural
operations
on
the
human
mind
by
it
we
are
led
to
believe
that
we
are
all
miserable
and
ruined
wretches
corrupt
and
exceedingly
wicked
from
our
very
birth
naturally
sinful
and
opposed
to
the
will
of
god
in
all
our
actions
words
and
thoughts
and
so
far
from
deserving
the
common
blessings
of
life
that
if
justice
had
been
done
us
we
should
long
since
have
been
cast
into
endless
punishment
tribulation
distress
and
sore
trials
are
the
common
lot
of
mankind
especially
the
good
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
this
world
it
tells
us
is
a
wretched
tiresome
and
accursed
place
a
mere
sink
of
guilt
and
misery
and
all
its
enjoyments
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
though
by
the
bye
those
who
are
called
sincere
and
pious
christians
seem
to
be
as
desirous
of
continuing
in
it
and
tasting
the
good
it
affords
as
the
most
sensual
and
sinner
it
likewise
instils
into
its
followers
such
a
servile
fear
and
dread
of
the
wrath
of
heaven
that
they
can
neither
lie
down
at
night
nor
rise
in
the
morning
without
first
attempting
by
intreaty
flattery
and
fair
promises
to
appease
the
divine
anger
and
persuade
the
almighty
to
permit
them
to
exist
in
peace
every
accident
is
a
judgement
and
a
prelude
to
further
punishment
every
misfortune
that
happens
to
their
neighbours
is
a
warning
to
them
and
they
are
liable
every
moment
to
be
cut
off
by
an
avenging
god
and
sent
to
hell
while
on
the
one
hand
they
represent
the
deity
as
their
servant
to
assist
them
on
every
occasion
averting
every
ill
they
bring
upon
themselves
and
extricating
them
from
every
difficulty
and
distress
they
plunge
themselves
into
on
the
other
he
is
supposed
to
be
a
fierce
revengeful
tyrant
delighting
in
cruelty
punishing
his
creatures
for
the
very
sins
which
he
causes
them
to
commit
and
creating
numberless
millions
of
immortal
souls
that
could
never
have
offended
him
for
the
express
purpose
of
tormenting
them
to
all
eternity
thus
they
are
generally
miserable
through
life
in
meditating
on
death
and
its
supposed
consequences
the
authority
of
the
bible
appears
still
more
doubtful
from
the
absurdities
and
contradictions
it
contains
contradictions
which
all
the
sophistical
ingenuity
of
reverend
divines
with
their
literal
meaning
of
this
text
and
spiritual
interpretation
of
that
can
never
explain
or
reconcile
in
the
very
first
chapter
of
the
whole
volume
containing
an
account
of
the
creation
we
find
an
inexplicable
difficulty
in
genesis
i
we
are
told
that
god
created
man
and
blessed
and
said
unto
but
in
ii
we
find
that
there
was
not
an
help
meet
for
adam
therefore
ver
god
said
it
is
not
good
that
man
should
be
alone
and
ver
he
made
a
woman
and
brought
her
unto
the
man
the
almighty
according
to
many
parts
of
the
bible
is
a
perfect
unchangeable
being
in
isaiah
he
is
said
to
declare
that
he
is
not
as
a
man
that
he
should
repent
but
in
other
places
we
read
of
his
repenting
very
frequently
he
repented
that
he
had
made
man
having
determined
to
destroy
the
israelites
and
having
slain
seventy
thousand
of
them
he
repented
of
the
evil
and
spared
the
rest
he
told
hezekiah
that
he
should
surely
die
and
not
live
but
immediately
repented
and
gave
him
fifteen
years
longer
jonah
prophesied
in
his
name
that
in
forty
days
nineveh
should
be
overthrown
but
the
people
believing
him
though
he
did
not
perform
his
promise
and
forsaking
their
sins
he
repented
of
the
evil
that
he
said
he
would
do
unto
them
and
did
it
not
in
one
place
it
says
our
god
is
a
consuming
fire
and
in
another
god
is
love
he
is
said
to
be
jealous
revengeful
and
angry
with
the
wicked
every
day
and
pleased
again
as
often
as
they
repent
possessing
all
the
good
and
evil
qualities
of
man
that
unstable
wicked
miserable
and
insignificant
worm
notwithstanding
all
this
he
is
perfectly
just
wise
immutable
and
can
never
repent
the
christian
system
i
venture
to
affirm
has
been
the
cause
of
more
evil
in
the
world
than
any
other
that
ever
appeared
in
it
by
inculcating
a
belief
that
the
deity
was
a
terrible
god
an
inexorable
judge
taking
vengeance
on
all
his
enemies
its
professors
wishing
to
conform
as
much
as
possible
to
the
character
and
disposition
of
have
in
all
ages
acted
with
the
same
spirit
and
upon
the
same
principles
o
let
this
strong
unerring
hand
thy
bolts
for
ever
throw
and
deal
damnation
round
the
land
on
each
i
judge
thy
foe
inspired
with
the
most
vindictive
hatred
to
all
who
do
not
subscribe
to
the
principles
they
profess
who
are
according
to
their
faith
enemies
for
they
say
there
is
no
medium
or
neutrality
all
who
are
not
for
us
are
against
us
they
have
never
failed
in
any
country
and
at
all
times
when
they
had
the
power
to
exercise
the
most
cruel
and
detestable
spirit
that
ever
disgraced
human
nature
not
contented
with
insulting
oppressing
enslaving
and
butchering
the
poor
heretics
here
but
most
humanely
and
charitably
condemning
them
to
everlasting
torments
hereafter
during
the
first
years
of
its
existence
christianity
occasioned
the
destruction
of
many
millions
of
mankind
in
the
first
part
of
this
period
the
christians
were
the
greatest
sufferers
but
in
the
year
maxentius
and
his
army
of
were
most
of
them
drowned
in
the
tiber
or
slain
by
constantine
the
christian
emperor
who
in
three
great
battles
in
one
of
which
were
killed
reduced
and
put
to
death
licinus
the
deputy
emperor
of
the
east
persecuted
the
heathens
and
destroyed
their
idols
the
symbols
of
their
divinities
in
the
twelfth
and
subsequent
centuries
millions
of
waldenses
and
protestants
were
murdered
in
the
south
of
france
how
many
millions
lost
their
lives
in
the
mad
crusades
for
the
recovery
of
the
holy
land
in
germany
and
flanders
in
england
scotland
and
ireland
in
south
america
but
i
stop
or
i
could
a
tale
unfold
whose
lightest
word
would
harrow
up
the
soul
chill
the
blood
with
horror
and
draw
forth
curses
from
the
grave
against
the
very
name
of
a
religion
which
has
been
made
the
pretext
for
such
cruelties
indeed
it
is
impossible
to
calculate
the
mischief
that
has
attended
the
christian
system
since
its
commencement
but
say
its
advocates
all
this
was
done
by
antichrist
or
the
false
church
which
then
is
the
true
church
not
that
which
persecutes
and
what
church
is
that
the
church
of
rome
no
for
that
after
long
struggles
no
sooner
became
established
in
power
than
it
persecuted
its
dissenting
sons
with
all
the
zeal
and
barbarity
that
it
had
experienced
from
its
enemies
the
church
of
england
no
for
although
that
separated
from
the
church
of
rome
and
rejected
many
of
the
errors
and
corruptions
which
had
crept
into
it
yet
no
sooner
was
it
fully
established
in
great
britain
than
it
very
carefully
trod
over
the
steps
of
the
mother
church
persecuted
roman
catholics
and
all
dissenters
the
puritans
who
fled
to
this
country
for
the
sake
of
freedom
of
conscience
and
religious
liberty
were
no
sooner
settled
than
they
discovered
the
same
illiberal
persecuting
spirit
which
drove
them
hither
and
persecuted
the
quakers
in
their
turn
becoming
as
corrupt
as
any
of
the
former
churches
each
of
them
while
they
were
weak
and
defenceless
suffered
by
the
murderous
hand
of
its
oppressors
and
when
become
strong
and
powerful
persecuted
and
martyred
its
feebler
enemies
and
i
believe
there
is
not
a
church
in
christendom
but
would
if
it
could
not
convert
most
gladly
destroy
all
its
opposers
had
it
that
one
essential
and
only
necessary
quality
for
they
affirm
that
the
world
with
all
its
blessings
are
nothing
but
temptations
to
draw
them
away
from
their
true
interest
and
that
unbelievers
of
every
kind
are
their
natural
implacable
enemies
the
carnal
mind
say
they
is
enmity
to
god
and
his
people
themselves
and
is
in
continual
opposition
to
every
thing
good
and
heavenly
they
must
then
of
necessity
wage
an
eternal
war
against
all
who
do
not
acknowledge
their
system
as
the
only
sure
guide
to
heaven
the
powerful
blow
which
has
been
aimed
at
this
system
of
faith
by
paine
age
of
reason
has
created
a
general
and
alarm
that
work
to
every
bigotted
or
interested
follower
of
christianity
appears
in
a
dreadful
light
indeed
as
it
is
a
direct
attack
upon
their
favourite
their
system
of
gospel
faith
which
exalts
them
in
their
own
opinions
so
much
above
the
rest
of
mankind
the
christian
theology
is
so
favourable
to
the
pride
and
vanity
of
man
that
the
slightest
attempt
to
overturn
it
occasions
an
universal
panic
in
its
supporters
who
immediately
display
all
the
ensigns
of
their
cause
the
pompous
anathemas
of
scripture
to
frighten
the
bold
invader
of
their
aërial
territories
so
far
they
act
consistently
for
where
they
have
no
weapons
or
defence
from
nature
and
reason
fear
and
hope
though
unfounded
and
delusive
are
the
only
expedients
left
by
representing
the
terrors
of
their
law
in
the
most
horrid
colours
the
wretched
victim
of
their
designs
cries
out
in
the
depth
of
despair
lord
what
shall
i
do
to
be
saved
the
work
is
then
in
a
certain
way
of
success
the
convert
gives
himself
up
to
the
direction
of
the
church
in
all
things
and
is
ever
after
the
passive
tool
of
its
power
these
converts
are
seldom
or
never
made
by
pure
reason
and
sound
argument
for
these
would
never
answer
the
purpose
but
the
passions
which
may
be
driven
by
every
gale
that
blows
the
fickle
and
inconstant
passions
are
so
influenced
by
the
power
of
false
eloquence
in
violent
declamations
and
vehement
harangues
that
the
calm
even
voice
of
reason
is
not
heard
or
is
disregarded
amidst
the
bustle
of
jarring
emotions
and
the
poor
frightened
wretch
catches
hold
of
the
first
object
that
is
held
out
to
save
him
from
his
fancied
perishing
and
undone
condition
without
ever
once
considering
whether
the
profession
they
embrace
is
founded
in
nature
and
reason
they
confide
wholly
in
the
piety
of
their
spiritual
teacher
leave
their
faith
and
hope
altogether
in
his
hands
and
trust
entirely
upon
his
promises
and
power
their
belief
he
can
alter
or
abolish
at
pleasure
for
what
he
preaches
they
must
adhere
to
what
he
allows
they
must
profess
what
he
approves
must
be
true
in
fact
the
christian
system
has
never
yet
been
weighed
in
the
impartial
balance
of
reason
or
received
a
candid
trial
in
the
thinking
world
force
fraud
and
other
unfair
means
have
always
been
necessarily
employed
for
its
establishment
had
it
been
founded
on
truth
or
consistent
with
common
sense
its
advocates
would
never
have
refused
to
submit
it
to
reason
and
the
cool
dispassionate
judgement
of
mankind
but
they
well
knew
that
it
could
never
stand
the
test
and
this
would
be
the
certain
means
of
its
destruction
they
therefore
boldly
and
presumptuously
tell
the
world
that
it
is
beyond
the
reach
of
human
reason
which
is
not
competent
to
judge
rightly
of
it
they
confess
that
we
can
not
comprehend
a
great
part
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
command
us
to
believe
it
though
we
can
not
understand
it
it
has
been
the
peculiarly
honourable
lot
of
thomas
paine
the
firm
advocate
of
truth
the
undaunted
champion
of
reason
and
the
resolute
and
unconquerable
enemy
of
tyranny
bigotry
and
prejudice
to
open
the
door
to
free
and
impartial
enquiry
he
has
boldly
entered
the
field
himself
and
taught
the
world
that
no
true
system
of
principles
however
sacred
they
may
be
held
in
the
public
opinion
and
however
strongly
protected
and
enforced
by
the
terrors
of
man
vengeance
here
and
eternal
punishment
hereafter
is
too
awful
to
be
canvassed
by
reason
or
too
sublime
to
be
comprehended
by
common
sense
the
christian
system
as
it
is
not
consistent
with
reason
is
declared
to
be
above
it
and
should
be
received
even
if
it
does
not
appear
clear
and
intelligible
to
our
human
capacities
this
by
prohibiting
enquiry
effectually
prevents
detection
of
falsehood
and
confirmation
of
truth
the
doctrine
is
received
upon
trust
upon
the
credit
of
our
forefathers
because
they
taught
or
rather
said
so
we
must
implicitly
believe
so
all
the
remonstrances
of
reason
and
experience
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
this
is
certainly
a
very
great
absurdity
for
there
once
was
a
beginning
to
every
system
or
theory
in
being
and
at
that
beginning
it
was
necessary
to
exercise
reason
as
the
unerring
guide
to
direct
in
the
choice
or
rejection
thereof
if
mankind
were
not
only
allowed
but
necessitated
to
weigh
every
doctrine
in
the
infallible
balance
of
reason
at
any
time
why
are
we
not
entitled
to
the
same
privilege
at
present
is
our
reason
degenerated
are
our
faculties
impaired
or
rather
are
we
not
far
more
wise
and
enlightened
than
mankind
were
centuries
ago
and
much
more
competent
to
understand
and
judge
of
things
than
they
were
by
the
practice
before
mentioned
by
that
tyranny
over
the
minds
of
men
which
has
ever
been
exercised
in
despotic
states
the
grossest
falsehoods
have
been
forced
upon
the
world
for
realities
and
the
most
detestable
impositions
established
and
maintained
in
all
the
strength
and
vigour
of
immutable
truth
but
these
arts
how
long
soever
they
may
prosper
and
by
whatever
authority
they
may
be
supported
though
they
may
call
to
their
aid
all
the
powers
of
superstition
and
prejudices
of
education
and
be
assisted
by
the
pride
and
deceit
of
hypocritical
bigots
and
mercenary
tyrants
still
must
they
finally
fall
and
sink
into
contemptuous
oblivion
the
present
state
of
society
seems
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
advancement
of
truth
and
destruction
of
error
the
sun
of
reason
has
begun
to
appear
dispelling
the
thick
and
almost
impenetrable
mists
of
ignorance
and
superstition
illuminating
the
most
secret
recesses
of
the
mind
and
will
continue
to
increase
in
splendour
till
it
shine
forth
in
one
clear
unclouded
and
eternal
day
the
writings
of
modern
philosophers
have
served
greatly
to
illuminate
the
minds
of
the
present
generation
i
will
here
quote

description
of
that
and
religion
which
mankind

a
state

from
an
attentive
perusal
of
such
liberal
enlightened
writers
as
pope
locke
hume
who
were
not
interested
in
forcing
any
unnatural
systems
upon
mankind
whose
only
aim
was
the
happiness
of
the
human
race
and
from
my
own
reflections
i
have
adopted
the
following
which
i
here
submit
to
the
impartial
consideration
of
my
of
all
denominations
i
believe
in
one
god
or
first
cause
wise
powerful
and
good
and
too
far
above
the
influence
of
human
actions
to
be
affected
by
any
thing
that
can
be
done
on
earth
i
believe
in
the
equality
of
men
by
nature
though
so
different
by
accident
the
universal
power
of
conscience
and
the
unerring
authority
of
natural
reason
i
believe
the
whole
duty
of
man
is
comprised
in
this
one
great
republican
principle
do
just
as
you
would
be
done
my
reasons
for
believing
thus
are
in
the
first
place
that
this
first
is
wise
and
powerful
beyond
our
conception
is
clearly
evinced
in
the
wonderful
formation
and
disposition
of
nature
exhibited
in
every
thing
that
we
have
any
perception
of
that
he
is
good
the
whole
creation
proves
for
we
find
nothing
made
but
what
is
useful
beneficial
and
conducive
to
the
happiness
of
the
whole
and
that
he
is
too
far
above
the
reach
of
human
actions
to
be
affected
by
any
thing
that
can
be
done
on
earth
is
inferred
from
nature
reason
and
experience
for
the
only
idea
that
we
can
form
of
the
deity
is
that
he
is
a
perfect
unchangeable
being
and
if
we
suppose
that
he
so
particularly
notices
the
conduct
of
mankind
as
to
be
differently
affected
by
their
different
actions
we
must
allow
that
he
is
an
imperfect
changeable
being
liable
to
be
pleased
or
vexed
at
the
mere
will
and
pleasure
of
his
creatures
and
dependent
upon
the
whim
and
caprice
of
in
the
second
place
it
appears
from
the
experience
of
mankind
in
all
ages
that
nature
in
the
creation
of
man
acts
impartially
and
equally
but
leaves
his
talents
disposition
to
be
regulated
by
mere
accidental
circumstances
that
conscience
has
an
universal
power
is
evident
from
the
dislike
and
abhorrence
with
which
all
mankind
look
upon
actions
that
tend
to
the
injury
of
society
and
not
to
believe
in
the
unerring
authority
of
natural
reason
would
be
to
accuse
the
deity
of
injustice
for
not
creating
us
capable
of
distinguishing
good
from
evil
and
then
punishing
us
for
the
evil
we
commit
in
the
third
place
that
the
whole
duty
of
man
is
comprised
in
this
one
great
republican
principle
do
as
you
would
be
done
unto
has
appeared
so
notorious
to
the
world
in
all
ages
that
it
has
been
universally
agreed
upon
as
the
unerring
rule
of
action
and
the
basis
of
happiness
by
the
observing
of
which
there
can
be
neither
oppression
deceit
or
injustice
of
any
kind
the
duty
of
man
is
his
interest
his
interest
is
to
make
himself
happy
and
the
surest
and
best
way
of
doing
this
is
to
promote
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
finally
that
system
of
religion
which
contradicts
itself
can
not
be
wholly
that
which
is
not
consistent
with
reason
or
agreeable
to
the
order
of
nature
must
be
false
as
different
from
the
will
of
the
deity
displayed
in
all
his
works
and
that
which
tends
to
promote
discord
pride
and
deceit
is
prejudicial
to
society
and
ought
to
be
discountenanced
and
opposed
by
every
good
man
on
miraculous
conversions
it
appears
to
be
the
general
opinion
among
the
learned
that
all
matter
is
more
or
less
in
a
continual
state
of
transmutation
that
there
is
a
perpetual
repulsion
and
attraction
in
nature
it
is
also
the
opinion
of
many
philosophers
that
the
human
mind
is
never
quite
stationary
that
locality
early
habits
examples
affections
and
associations
have
the
greatest
effect
in
forming
the
characters
and
opinions
of
men
is
evident
to
our
senses
and
that
after
the
character
may
be
considered
to
be
formed
a
contrary
course
of
habits
of
equally
long
or
longer
continuance
will
generally
produce
a
contrary
character
every
attentive
observer
must
perceive
that
we
sometimes
dislike
and
entertain
an
unfavourable
opinion
of
what
we
at
another
time
approve
and
cordially
agree
to
to
a
cursory
examiner
these
alterations
may
appear
to
take
place
arbitrarily
but
to
one
acquainted
with
the
philosophy
of
the
human
mind
accustomed
minutely
to
trace
the
different
links
and
associations
which
bias
our
ideas
they
will
appear
so
far
from
being
arbitrary
or
supernatural
to
be
perfectly
natural
and
agreeable
to
the
wise
order
of
things
it
would
seem
that
most
parties
agree
to
the
reasons
given
by
the
learned
for
such
alterations
except
they
be
in
matters
of
religion
here
each
party
abandons
the
usual
methods
of
philosophising
and
has
recourse
to
the
supernatural
interference
of
divine
agency
that
extraordinary
instances
of
conversion
from
vice
to
virtue
from
error
to
truth
sometimes
take
place
for
which
the
most
profound
and
subtle
reasoners
fail
to
give
satisfactory
causes
is
most
readily
granted
but
still
it
may
be
said
that
our
not
being
able
to
trace
a
natural
cause
is
no
proof
of
there
being
none
for
past
experience
has
abundantly
proved
to
the
world
the
folly
of
such
kind
of
inferences
many
things
in
science
and
philosophy
are
now
even
demonstrable
that
formerly
were
with
equally
good
reason
considered
to
be
miraculous
or
supernatural
there
are
many
reasons
for
considering
the
religious
conversions
not
supernatural
there
are
no
human
criteria
to
determine
when
they
are
from
god
and
when
they
are
not
so
many
and
so
frequent
impositions
and
deceptions
take
place
that
there
is
no
distinguishing
the
false
from
the
true
these
enlightenments
are
equally
claimed
by
every
sect
however
different
in
opinion
now
supposing
them
to
be
from
god
we
are
under
the
necessity
of
believing
that
there
can
be
only
one
sect
which
can
really
have
them
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
the
immutable
creator
of
all
things
would
inspire
his
creatures
to
believe
as
true
opposite
and
different
doctrines
and
the
confining
of
the
divine
influence
to
one
sect
only
certainly
appears
to
be
partial
and
arbitrary
and
contrary
to
the
saying
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
people
professing
to
be
converted
can
never
give
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
their
state
either
to
others
or
themselves
so
as
to
do
away
all
apprehension
that
they
may
not
be
actuated
by
impulse
fear
affections
with
a
variety
of
other
natural
causes
which
every
day
make
astonishing
alterations
in
the
minds
of
men
we
sometimes
meet
with
individuals
who
at
one
time
considered
themselves
to
be
inspired
and
shewed
every
outward
sign
and
afterwards
declare
they
conceive
they
never
were
sudden
and
extraordinary
changes
frequently
take
place
for
the
worse
but
these
are
never
accounted
as
supernatural
it
appears
that
conversions
most
frequently
take
place
after
some
circumstances
which
naturally
have
a
tendency
to
fix
the
attention
soften
the
affections
affect
the
passions
and
subdue
the
will
such
as
attending
religious
discourses
the
deathbed
of
a
friend
extreme
pain
poverty
and
distress
now
may
not
these
be
said
to
account
for
the
first
natural
link
then
why
should
the
rest
of
the
chain
be
miraculous
if
these
observations
were
untrue
we
might
expect
to
find
conversions
occur
as
frequently
among
one
sort
of
society
as
among
another
but
that
is
not
the
case
it
is
observable
in
religious
as
well
as
in
other
operations
of
the
mind
that
those
alterations
which
are
the
most
sudden
and
vehement
are
generally
more
transient
than
those
which
take
place
more
gradually
and
after
accountable
associations
we
might
naturally
expect
that
those
divinely
inspired
would
be
superior
to
the
weaknesses
of
passion
and
imperfections
of
nature
incidental
to
others
but
our
converts
appear
not
to
be
these
supernatural
affections
are
unattended
with
any
discernibly
supernatural
effects
the
possessors
of
them
never
perform
miracles
from
these
observations
it
is
presumed
that
there
is
abundant
reason
for
apprehending
that
those
conversions
termed
supernatural
are
nothing
more
than
nature
acting
upon
the
mind
of
man
agreeably
to
those
wise
and
immutable
laws
laid
down
by
the
adorable
maker
of
all
things
and
the
reason
of
our
terming
them
miraculous
is
because
we
are
unable
with
our
weak
faculties
to
trace
the
wonderful
concatenations
and
view
the
infinite
variety
of
shades
of
which
the
intellectual
part
of
man
is
susceptible
at
the
same
time
it
is
confessed
that
it
being
a
matter
of
internal
feeling
and
what
can
not
perhaps
be
demonstrated
either
way
no
arguments
on
the
subject
can
be
hoped
of
any
material
benefit
either
to
the
person
who
supposes
himself
to
have
it
but
can
not
explain
it
or
to

that
has

their
parents
and
according
to
education
without
ever
afterwards
examining
for
themselves
now
as
this
belief
arises
from
causes
that
are
variable
and
quite
independent
of
the
believers
it
follows
that
there
is
no
security
whatever
for
its
being
true
the
chance
being
always
against
it
consequently
such
persons
opinions
are
of
no
weight
in
the
dispute
a
due
attention
to
this
consideration
will
it
is
presumed
render
the
number
of
real
believers
and
unbelievers
in
christian
countries
much
less
unequal
than
at
first
we
may
be
inclined
to
suppose
the
evidence
for
christianity
is
founded
on
probabilities
by
a
process
of
reasoning
not
being
intuitive
or
the
contrary
of
its
being
true
can
easily
be
conceived
and
does
not
imply
a
contradiction
owing
to
the
different
constitutions
of
the
human
mind
there
always
is
more
or
less
a
certain
difference
of
opinion
upon
all
subjects
in
proportion
to
their
want
of
proof
then
when
a
subject
confessedly
has
it
not
ought
we
to
expect
from
it
those
universal
results
which
it
could
only
produce
by
having
it
that
there
should
be
many
who
are
not
satisfied
with
the
evidence
of
the
christian
religion
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
since
it
is
not
of
that
nature
to
produce
universal
acquiescence
where
then
can
be
the
propriety
of
inveighing
so
bitterly
against
some
for
rejecting
what
according
to
the
nature
of
things
all
can
not
be
expected
to
receive
assuredly
the
sin
of
doubting
must
be
proportional
to
the
evidence
then
why
should
we
attach
the
same
punishment
for
disbelieving
things
that
are
not
as
we
do
for
things
that
are
with
regard
to
the
assertions
that
is
their
pride
prevents
their
belief
that
they
make
a
deity
of
their
reason
and
put
themselves
in
opposition
to
heaven
it
may
be
seriously
asked
are
these
assertors
sincere
in
what
they
say
or
is
it
merely
spleen
they
or
any
one
for
an
instant
conceive
it
to
be
possible
for
a
man
in
his
senses
who
has
any
idea
of
his
maker
or
of
himself
and
is
so
deeply
interested
in
the
subject
to
act
in
such
a
way
there
may
be
some
reason
for
considering
that
doctrine
to
be
false
which
might
cause
us
to
think
existence
a
curse
rather
than
a
blessing
and
to
entertain
views
inconsistent
with
the
divine
nature
if
the
orthodox
opinions
be
correct
how
few
among
professors
really
profess
how
small
a
proportion
of
mankind
profess
at
all
it
follows
according
to
even
probability
that
the
number
of
the
saved
will
be
extremely
small
in
proportion
to
that
which
is
lost
then
when
a
child
is
born
according
to
the
laws
of
chances
there
are
very
great
odds
against
its
being
saved
query
whether
it
be
a
blessing
to
be
born
to
run
any
risk
at
all
of
endless
misery

were

very
contrary
of
what
they
appear
to
be
greatly
in
favour

everlasting
bliss
bristol
theophilanthropist
deism
examined
by
a
christian
it
has
often
been
said
that
if
christianity
is
not
competent
to
withstand
the
test
of
reason
it
ought
to
fall
to
this
opinion
i
willingly
subscribe
and
so
confident
am
i
of
our
succeeding
against
our
adversaries
the
deists
that
i
am
for
truly
putting
christianity
to
this
trial
that
is
i
would
that
there
should
be
allowed
as
perfectly
free
discussion
in
all
theological
matters
that
the
age
of
reason
and
other
works
of
a
similar
nature
should
be
allowed
to
be
published
let
the
enemies
of
our
religion
bring
forward
their
objections
as
fast
as
they
like
have
we
not
or
our
part
a
ready
refutation
for
every
one
of
them
the
deists
i
know
have
strongly
contended
that
many
actions
recorded
in
the
bible
said
to
have
been
done
by
the
express
command
of
god
are
shocking
to
humanity
and
in
contradiction
to
all
our
ideas
of
moral
justice
such
as
putting
whole
nations
to
the
sword
sparing
neither
age
nor
infancy
utterly
destroying
men
women
and
children
leaving
not
a
soul
to
breathe
but
does
not
the
bishop
of
llandaff
reconcile
this
seeming
incongruity
and
vindicate
the
morality
of
the
sacred
writings
by
explaining
that
as
the
almighty
constantly
superintends
all
the
actions
of
nature
and
in
so
doing
permits
or
rather
causes
smiling
infants
so
to
be
swallowed
up
by
earthquakes
or
destroyed
by
other
natural
means
it
is
evident
that
these
shocking
transactions
as
they
are
called
recorded
in
the
bible
do
not
militate
in
the
least
against
the
character
of
the
deity
the
unbelievers
certainly
may
bring
a
puerile
argument
against
this
profound
assertion
of
the
bishop
but
the
christian
who
truly
appreciates
the
real
value
of
an
unwavering
will
have
for
such
argument
a
thorough
contempt
even
before
he
reads
it
they
may
tell
us
if
they
choose
that
nature
being
actuated
by
general
and
unvarying
laws
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
the
almighty
in
order
to
save
a
human
creature
will
perform
a
miracle
or
to
state
the
case
more
particularly
if
a
society
of
human
beings
will
be
so
unthinking
and
imprudent
as
to
make
their
residence
at
the
bottom
of
mount
vesuvius
or
etna
that
the
creator
will
partially
suspend
the
laws
of
nature
in
order
that
the
burning
lavas
may
not
overwhelm
them
in
destruction
or
that
if
mortals
will
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
build
their
dwellings
on
the
site
of
former
desolations
as
lisbon
for
instance
that
the
almighty
will
interpose
in
order
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
another
earthquake
or
that
god
will
in
any
case
partially
suspend
the
eternal
laws
of
the
universe
in
order
to
preserve
a
mortal
that
may
be
accidentally
liable
to
be
destroyed
by
their
effects
they
may
tell
us
all
this
if
they
choose
and
likewise
that
this
is
quite
another
thing
to
an
express
command
from
god
himself
to
one
set
of
human
beings
to
annihilate
thus
we
refute
it
all
such
arguments
are
built
on
which
it
behoves
every
pious
christian
to
distrust
let
them
assert
that
jesus
christ
himself
if
there
was
such
a
person
has
proved
the
delusion
he
laboured
under
since
he
actually
and
distinctly
predicted
in
more
places
than
one
that
his
second
coming
would
be
in
the
days
of
the
last
surviving
apostles
and
that
the
apostles
themselves
sufficiently
shew
by
their
writings
that
such
was
their
opinion
let
them
descant
upon
the
description
of
his
coming
in
the
clouds
as
related
in
the
gospel
with
the
trumpets
sounding
before
him
and
call
it
a
mere
representation
of
human
pageantry
and
unworthy
of
being
imputed
to
the
almighty
creator
who
has
millions
of
millions
of
worlds
at
his
command
we
thus
refute
the
first
part
of
this
misrepresentation
jesus
after
predicting
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
as
we
find
it
now
related
speaks
of
his
second
coming
and
gives
a
description
how
he
will
appear
in
the
clouds
with
the
angels
sounding
their
trumpets
before
him
and
then
continues
thus
verily
i
say
unto
you
generation
shall
not
pass
away
till
all
these
things
be
now
it
is
evident
that
this
last
verse
can
only
allude
to
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
and
that
the
passage
is
misplaced
by
many
sentences
it
is
true
we
have
no
vouchers
for
this
nor
can
we
perceive
what
instance
there
could
have
been
for
any
one
to
have
made
the
alteration
but
as
more
than
seventeen
centuries
have
revolved
since
the
death
of
christ
and
no
second
coming
yet
taken
place
we
are
fully
justified
in
maintaining
the
passage
to
be
misplaced
the
deists
accuse
us
of
all
along
suppressing
their
works
and
certainly
in
this
respect
i
must
acknowledge
we
have
acted
unfairly
they
say
that
most
of
the
ancient
productions
on
their
side
the
question
are
lost
while
the
answers
to
them
are
still
extant
from
this
circumstance
they
infer
designing
and
superstitious
monks
and
priests
in
order
to
remove
every
thing
out
of
the
way
that
might
militate
against
their
doctrine
destroyed
all
the
writings
of
their
opponents
while
they
carefully
preserved
those
of
their
own
party
it
is
likewise
affirmed
the
book
entitled
the
age
of
reason
is
a
more
formidable
enemy
to
christianity
than
any
work
ever
before
published
and
threatens
should
it
become
popular
to
shake
its
flimsy
fabric
for
thus
they
speak
of
our
religion
to
its
very
foundation
that
the
charge
of
blasphemy
is
brought
against
it
to
suppress
it
solely
from
fear
of
this
consequence
and
that
our
oft
repeated
assertion
if
christianity
can
not
withstand
the
test
of
reason
it
ought
to
fall
is
a
mere
mockery
for
in
fact
we
fully
prove
our
intention
is
never
to
bring
our
doctrine
to
such
a
tribunal
i
am
very
sorry
that
this
last
charge
against
us
is
not
altogether
unfounded
why
should
not
the
arguments
of
our
opponents
be
allowed
to
be
published
their
authors
would
very
soon
i
am
fully
persuaded
meet
with
a
total
discomfiture
and
find
our
polemics
more
than
competent
to
justify
their
own
cause
every
one
knows
that
paine
was
illiterate
that
is
he
only
knew
his
own
language
perfectly
and
had
a
smattering
of
french
now
have
we
not
bishops
deacons
lecturers
curates
who
are
acquainted
with
hebrew
greek
syriac
arabic
latin
and
several
other
tongues
living
as
well
as
dead
and
surely
it
would
be
strange
if
with
all
this
various
learning
aided
by
their
laborious
researches
into
the
antiquated
writings
of
the
primitive
christians
those
credible
attesters
of
and
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
overturn
such
a
paltry
antagonist
as
thomas
paine
who
alas
made
use
of
no
other
weapon
but
who
ridiculed
as
a
mere
and
maintained
that
a
strict
observance
of
constituted
the
only
worship
that
was
in
pleasing
to
the
deity
physiologists
have
asserted
i
know
that
the
human
brain
is
only
capable
of
a
certain
degree
of
active
energy
and
that
every
additional
talent
we
may
acquire
must
be
gained
at
the
expence
of
all
the
other
powers
and
that
consequently
he
who
is
familiar
with
a
variety
of
languages
can
not
possibly
think
very
profoundly
in
any
the
whole
of
his
intellect
being
absorbed
and
the
pure
ideal
part
of
it
absolutely
extinguished
in
the
complicated
matter
of
grammatical
construction
and
the
endless
labour
of
committing
to
memory
the
various
characters
and
innumerable
quantity
of
words
necessary
for
obtaining
such
knowledge
on
the
other
hand
it
is
boldly
averred
that
he
who
knows
his
own
language
perfectly
and
no
other
may
become
as
it
were
in
his
very
essence
a
compound
of
thought
and
reflection
capable
of
drawing
from
the
luminous
stores
of
his
own
understanding
alone
arguments
that
shall
put
to
flight
all
the
scholastic
quibbling
of
the
mere
christian
linguist
causing
the
gloom
engendered
by
his
subtilties
to
vanish
like
mist
before
the
sun
the
deists
accuse
us
of
disturbing
the
last
moments
of
the
virtuous
and
terrifying
their
imaginations
with
the
prospect
of
eternal
damnation
they
say
that
when
such
infatuated
persons
whose
bodily
weakness
renders
them
more
than
childish
become
overwhelmed
with
the
dreadful
picture
and
give
way
to
the
weakness
of
humanity
that
we
then
infer
they
had
a
proper
sense
of
the
enormity
of
their
guilt
before
they
died
and
that
we
then
exclaim
in
the
gloomy
pomposity
of
the
fanatic
young
men
may
live
fools
but
fools
they
can
not
die
this
quotation
when
applied
to
the
case
in
question
the
deists
maintain
to
be
unjust
and
are
for
making
a
new
reading
as
being
rather
more
applicable
viz
men
may
live
wisely
but
fools
they
often
die
shame
the
deists
cry
forbear
to
disturb
the
departing
moralist
with
your
strange
dogmas
his
sole
trust
is
in
his
creator
therefore
let
his
last
hours
be
spent
in
peace
your
interference
is
useless
and
as
it
adds
to
the
sufferings
of
expiring
humanity
may
well
be
termed
impious
and
cruel
and
further
what
conviction
can
be
gained
from
making
public
the
imbecile
and
confessions
made
by
the
dying
for
as
rousseau
rightly
observes
it
is
reason
that
determines
our
belief
and
when
through
sickness
that
faintly
becomes
impaired
what
dependence
can
be
placed
on
any
opinion
we
may
then
adopt
all
this
seems
at
the
first
glance
very
striking
and
imposing
but
is
easily
refuted
i
shall
confine
myself
however
to
only
answering
the
latter
part
of
the
above
i
maintain
then
that
even
shouting
our
dogmas
in
the
ears
of
the
and
thereby
disturbing
their
last
moments
is
a
mere
trifle
when
put
in
competition
with
the
eternal
advantages
that
may
by
this
means
accrue
to
their
souls
it
is
well
known
that
christians
formerly
more
generally
than
at
present
did
not
scruple
to
compel
men
to
become
converts
and
when
the
heretics
as
they
were
termed
obstinately
held
out
they
actually
burnt
them
for
love
of
christ
this
manner
of
proceeding
paley
has
in
some
measure
justified
by
affirming
that
as
the
salvation
of
the
soul
is
a
matter
of
infinitely
more
importance
than
the
of
the
body
so
these
who
actually
believed
salvation
to
exclusively
depend
on
the
reception
of
their
dogmas
may
be
said
to
be
in
some
sort
excusable
for
endeavouring
by
all
the
means
within
their
power
to
save
a
soul
though
his
body
in
consequence
might
be
devoted
to
the
flames

some
i
know
would
go
further
and
urge
that
even
the
burning
of
those
who
converted
by
the
threats
of
the
holy
fathers
was
not
impolitic
since
it
may
be
justified
as
the
above
principle
of
preferring
the
welfare
of
the
soul
to
that
of
the
body
for
might
not
a
convert
made
so
against
the
evidence
of
his
own
reason
recant
and
thus
render
all
the
pious
zeal
of
those
quite
abortive
nothing
more
likely
and
therefore
to
make
sure
of
his
eternal
felicity
they
were
equally
excusable
in
committing
him
to
the
flames
a
similar
principle
influenced
the
pious
monk
towards
the
unfortunate
jew

related

but
somewhat
ancient

myself
let
them
be
brought
against
us
in

way
and
we
will
readily
refute
them
in

there
will
be
some
novelty
in
such
an
occupation
to
many
of
our
divines
who
have
passed
many
years
in
the
continued
sameness
of
preaching
to
congregations
who
are
much
too
passive
and
obedient
ever
to
dissent

single
syllable
from
the
doctrine
laid
down

is
now
several
years
since
our
doctors
of

really
exerted
their
talents
viz
ever
since
the
first
publicacation
of
the
age

i
think
it
downright
inconsistency
for
our
authorities
to
prosecute
those
who
publish
works
of
this
kind
seeing
those
works
absolutely
benefit
christianity

not
the

two
last
gentlemen
be
still
in
existence
and
chance
to
peruse
this
they
will
be
extremely
grateful
i
am
sure
for
my
thus
noticing
them
but
they
may
reserve
all
thanks
for
the
encomiums
i
have
passed
upon
them
are
nothing
more
than
their
real
deserts
but
to
conclude
seeing
i
say
that
deistical
works
are
beneficial
to
our
holy
and
only
true
religion
by
making
its
ministers
exert
their
talents
let
them
be
printed
and
freely
circulated
and
in
so
doing
we
shall
no
longer
lay
under
the
vile
odium
of
being
oppressors
and
persecutors
for
righteousness
sake
a
firm
believer
in
the
only
true
god
and
a
future
state
of
retribution
london
there
is
also
a
thompson
a
member
of
the
sect
called
free
thinking
christians
who
in
a
work
entitled
evidences
of
revealed
religion
on
a
new
plan
has
attempted
to
answer
some
of
the
objections
of
paine
but
as
his
arguments
though
said
to
be
quite
inconclusive
have
too
much
the
appearance
of
human
reason
i
have
not
thought
proper
to
mention
him
as
a
person
who
has
much
benefited
our
cause
and
especially
as
i
understand
that
implicit
faith
forms
no
part
of
the
creed
of
the
above
sect
