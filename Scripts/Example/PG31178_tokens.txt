notes
of
preface
i
dedicate
this
work
to
my
countrymen
in
whose
intelligence
magnanimity
and
humanity
i
place
the
utmost
reliance
although
they
have
long
suffered
themselves
to
be
swayed
by
a
prejudice
as
unmanly
as
it
is
wicked
and
have
departed
widely
from
the
golden
rule
of
the
gospel
in
their
treatment
of
the
people
of
color
to
suppose
that
they
will
always
be
the
despisers
and
persecutors
of
this
unfortunate
class
is
in
my
opinion
to
libel
their
character
a
change
in
their
feelings
and
sentiments
is
already
visible
a
change
which
promises
ere
long
to
redeem
their
character
from
the
bloody
stains
which
slavery
has
cast
upon
it
and
to
release
the
prisoner
from
his
chains
may
they
be
ashamed
to
persist
in
a
mean
and
thievish
course
of
conduct
and
afraid
to
quarrel
with
the
workmanship
of
god
may
a
righteous
indignation
be
kindled
in
their
breasts
against
a
combination
which
is
holding
them
up
for
the
scorn
and
contempt
of
other
nations
as
incorrigible
oppressors
whom
neither
nor
the
opinions
of
mankind
nor
the
fear
of
god
can
bring
to
repentance
their
duty
is
plain
and
it
may
easily
be
done
slavery
must
be
overthrown
either
by
their
own
moral
strength
or
by
the
physical
strength
of
the
slaves
let
them
imitate
the
example
of
the
people
of
by
seeking
the
immediate
overthrow
of
the
horrid
system
let
a
national
society
be
immediately
organized
the
object
of
which
shall
be
to
quicken
and
consolidate
the
moral
influence
of
the
nation
so
that
congress
and
the
state
legislatures
may
be
burdened
with
petitions
for
the
removal
of
the
evil
to
scatter
tracts
like
over
the
land
on
the
subject
of
slavery
to
employ
active
and
eloquent
agents
to
plead
the
cause
incessantly
and
to
form
auxiliary
societies
to
encourage
planters
to
cultivate
their
lands
by
freemen
by
offering
large
premiums
to
promote
education
and
the
mechanical
arts
among
the
free
people
of
color
and
to
recover
their
lost
rights
religious
professors
of
all
denominations
must
bear
unqualified
testimony
against
slavery
they
must
not
support
they
must
not
palliate
it
no
slaveholder
ought
to
be
embraced
within
the
pale
of
a
christian
church
consequently
the
churches
must
be
purified
by
fire
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
sustained
in
our
national
capacity
it
ought
therefore
to
be
prostrated
at
a
blow
the
clause
in
the
constitution
should
be
erased
which
tolerates
greatly
to
the
detriment
and
injustice
of
the
states
a
slave
representation
in
congress
why
should
property
be
represented
at
the
impoverished
south
and
not
at
the
opulent
north
to
impair
the
force
of
this
exposition
the
ardent
advocates
of
the
colonization
society
will
undoubtedly
attempt
to
evade
the
ground
of
controversy
and
lead
uncautious
minds
astray
in
a
labyrinth
of
sophistry
but
the
question
is
not
whether
the
climate
of
africa
is
salubrious
nor
whether
the
mortality
among
the
emigrants
has
been
excessive
nor
whether
the
colony
is
in
a
prosperous
condition
nor
whether
the
transportation
of
our
whole
colored
population
can
be
effected
in
thirty
years
or
three
centuries
nor
whether
any
slaves
have
been
emancipated
on
condition
of
banishment
but
whether
the
doctrines
and
principles
of
the
society
accord
with
the
doctrines
and
principles
of
the
gospel
whether
slaveholders
are
the
just
proprietors
of
their
slaves
whether
it
is
not
the
sacred
duty
of
the
nation
to
abolish
the
system
of
slavery
now
and
to
recognise
the
people
of
color
as
brethren
and
countrymen
who
have
been
unjustly
treated
and
covered
with
unmerited
shame
is
the
question
and
the
only
with
such
a
mass
of
evidence
before
them
of
the
pernicious
cruel
and
delusive
character
of
the
american
colonization
society
i
leave
the
patriot
the
philanthropist
and
the
christian
to
judge
of
the
fitness
of
the
following

and
presumptuous
assertions

insufferably
bright
spanning

sombre

human
wrong
that
have
accumulated
on
the
horizon
of
our
prosperity

and

always

nay
that
man
who
does
not
use
his
persevering
efforts
to
promote
its
benevolent
object
fails
in
our
opinion
to
discharge
his
duty
to
his
god
and
his
country
c
but
a
distinct
knowledge
and
a
calm
consideration
of
the
facts
in
the
case
is
wanting
to
make
every
man
of
common
intelligence
common
patriotism
and
common
humanity
the
earnest
friend
of
the
colonization
society
d
there
is
one
important
consideration
which
owing
to
the
contractedness
of
my
limits
i
have
omitted
to
enforce
in
this
work
it
is
this
the
serious
injury
which
our
interests
must
inevitably
suffer
by
the
removal
of
our
colored
population
their
labor
is
indispensably
necessary
and
extremely
valuable
by
whom
shall
the
plantations
at
the
south
be
cultivated
but
by
them
it
is
universally
conceded
that
they
can
resist
the
intensity
of
a
southern
sun
and
endure
the
fatigues
attendant
on
the
cultivation
of
rice
cotton
tobacco
and
better
than
white
laborers
at
least
their
bodies
are
now
inured
to
this
employment
i
do
not
believe
that
any
equivalent
would
induce
the
planters
to
part
with
their
services
or
white
laborers
to
occupy
their
places
in
the
great
cities
and
in
various
parts
of
the
southern
states
free
persons
of
color
constitute
a
laborious
and
useful
class
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
the
banishment
of
of
our
population
of
those
whom
we
specially
need
would
be
an
act
of
suicide
the
veriest
smatterer
in
political
economy
can
not
but
perceive
the
ruinous
tendency
of
such
a
measure

introductory
remarks
in
attacking
the
system
of
slavery
i
clearly
foresaw
all
that
has
happened
to
me
i
knew
at
the
commencement
that
my
motives
would
be
impeached
my
warnings
ridiculed
my
person
persecuted
my
sanity
doubted
my
life
jeoparded
but
the
clank
of
the
prisoner
chains
broke
upon
my
ear
it
entered
deeply
into
my
soul
i
looked
up
to
heaven
for
strength
to
sustain
me
in
the
perilous
work
of
emancipation
and
my
resolution
was
taken
in
opposing
the
american
colonization
society
i
have
also
counted
the
cost
and
as
clearly
foreseen
the
formidable
opposition
which
will
be
arrayed
against
me
many
of
the
clergy
are
enlisted
in
its
support
their
influence
is
powerful
men
of
wealth
and
elevated
station
are
among
its
contributors
wealth
and
station
are
almost
omnipotent
the
press
has
been
seduced
into
its
support
the
press
is
a
potent
engine
moreover
the
society
is
artfully
based
upon
and
defended
by
it
takes
advantage
of
wicked
and
preposterous
opinions
and
hence
its
success
these
things
grieve
they
can
not
deter
me
is
mighty
and
will
prevail
it
is
able
to
make
falsehood
blush
and
tear
from
hypocrisy
its
mask
and
annihilate
prejudice
and
overthrow
persecution
and
break
every
fetter
i
am
constrained
to
declare
with
the
utmost
sincerity
that
i
look
upon
the
colonization
scheme
as
inadequate
in
its
design
injurious
in
its
operation
and
contrary
to
sound
principle
and
the
more
scrupulously
i
examine
its
pretensions
the
stronger
is
my
conviction
of
its
sinfulness
nay
were
jehovah
to
speak
in
an
audible
voice
from
his
holy
habitation
i
am
persuaded
that
his
language
would
be
hath
required
this
at
your
hands
it
consoles
me
to
believe
that
no
man
who
knows
me
personally
or
by
reputation
will
suspect
the
honesty
of
my
skepticism
if
i
were
politic
and
intent
only
on
my
own
preferment
or
pecuniary
interest
i
should
swim
with
the
strong
tide
of
public
sentiment
instead
of
breasting
its
powerful
influence
the
hazard
is
too
great
the
labor
too
burdensome
the
remuneration
too
uncertain
the
contest
too
unequal
to
induce
a
selfish
adventurer
to
assail
a
combination
so
formidable
disinterested
opposition
and
sincere
conviction
however
are
not
conclusive
proofs
of
individual
rectitude
for
a
man
may
very
honestly
do
mischief
and
not
be
aware
of
his
error
indeed
it
is
in
this
light
i
view
many
of
the
friends
of
african
colonization
i
concede
to
them
benevolence
of
purpose
and
expansiveness
of
heart
but
in
my
opinion
they
are
laboring
under
the
same
delusion
as
that
which
swayed
saul
of
tarsus
persecuting
the
blacks
even
unto
a
strange
country
and
verily
believing
that
they
are
doing
god
service
i
blame
them
nevertheless
for
taking
this
mighty
scheme
upon
trust
for
not
perceiving
and
rejecting
the
monstrous
doctrines
avowed
by
the
master
spirits
in
the
crusade
and
for
feeling
so
indifferent
to
the
moral
political
and
social
advancement
of
the
free
people
of
color
in
this
their
only
legitimate
home
in
the
progress
of
this
discussion
i
shall
have
occasion
to
use
very
plain
and
sometimes
very
severe
language
this
would
be
an
unpleasant
task
did
not
duty
imperiously
demand
its
application
to
give
offence
i
am
loath
but
more
to
hide
or
modify
the
truth
i
shall
deal
with
the
society
in
its
collective
form
as
one
body
and
not
with
individuals
while
i
shall
be
necessitated
to
marshal
individual
opinions
in
review
i
protest
against
the
supposition
that
indiscriminate
censure
is
intended
or
that
every
friend
of
the
society
cherishes
similar
views
he
to
whom
my
reprehension
does
not
apply
will
not
receive
it
it
is
obviously
impossible
in
attacking
a
numerous
and
multiform
combination
to
exhibit
private
dissimilarities
or
in
every
instance
to
discriminate
between
the
various
shades
of
opinion
it
is
sufficient
that
exceptions
are
made
my
warfare
is
against
the
american
colonization
society
if
i
shall
identify
its
general
preponderating
and
clearly
developed
traits
it
must
stand
or
fall
as
they
shall
prove
benevolent
or
selfish
i
bring
to
this
momentous
investigation
an
unbiassed
mind
a
lively
sense
of
accountability
to
god
and
devout
aspirations
for
the
guidance
of
the
holy
spirit
unless
he
whom
there
is
no
darkness
at
all
pours
light
upon
my
path
i
shall
go
astray
i
have
taken
him
at
his
word
any
man
lack
wisdom
let
him
ask
of
god
and
it
shall
be
given
him
confessing
my
own
foolishness
i
have
sought
that
knowledge
which
can
not
err
i
would
premise
that
like
many
others
i
formerly
supposed
the
colonization
society
was
a
praiseworthy
association
although
i
always
doubted
its
efficiency
this
opinion
was
formed
for
me
by
others
upon
whom
i
placed
implicit
confidence
it
certainly
was
not
based
upon
any
research
or
knowledge
of
my
own
as
i
had
not
at
that
time
perused
a
single
report
of
the
society
nor
a
page
in
its
organ
the
african
repository
my
approval
was
the
offspring
of
credulity
and
ignorance
i
am
explicit
on
this
point
because
my
opponents
have
accused
me
of
inconsistency
though
it
ought
not
surely
to
disgrace
a
man
that
discovering
himself
to
be
in
error
he
promptly
turns
to
the
embrace
of
truth
as
if
opinions
once
formed
must
be
as
irrevocable
as
the
laws
of
the
medes
and
persians
if
this
were
so
accountability
would
lose
its
hold
on
the
conscience
and
the
light
of
knowledge
be
blown
out
and
reason
degenerate
into
brutish
instinct
much
stress
has
been
laid
upon
the
fact
that
in
i
delivered
an
address
in
on
the
fourth
of
july
on
which
occasion
a
collection
was
made
in
behalf
of
the
american
colonization
society
it
is
true
but
whereas
i
was
then
blind
now
i
see
my
address
however
was
far
from
being
acceptable
to
the
friends
of
colonization
who
were
present
not
only
on
account
of
my
denunciation
of
slaveholders
but
because
i
inserted
only
a
single
sentence
in
favor
of
the
society
in
all
my
writings
i
have
never
commended
this
combination
in
as
many
sentences
as
i
have
used
in
making
this
explanation
so
much
for
my
marvellous
apostacy
it
is
only
about
two
years
since
i
was
induced
to
examine
the
claims
of
the
colonization
society
upon
the
patronage
and
confidence
of
the
nation
i
went
to
this
examination
with
a
mind
biassed
by
preconceived
opinions
favorable
to
the
society
and
rather
for
the
purpose
of
defending
it
against
opposition
than
of
bringing
it
into
disrepute
every
thing
apart
from
its
principles
was
calculated
to
secure
my
friendship
nothing
but
its
revolting
features
could
have
induced
me
to
turn
loathingly
away
from
its
embrace
i
had
some
little
reputation
to
sustain
many
of
my
friends
were
colonizationists
i
saw
that
eminent
statesmen
and
honorable
men
were
enlisted
in
the
enterprise
the
great
body
of
the
clergy
gave
their
unqualified
support
to
it
every
fourth
of
july
the
charities
of
the
nation
were
secured
in
its
behalf
wherever
i
turned
my
eye
in
the
free
states
i
saw
nothing
but
unanimity
wherever
my
ear
caught
a
sound
i
heard
nothing
but
excessive
panegyric
no
individual
had
ventured
to
blow
the
trumpet
of
alarm
or
exert
his
energies
to
counteract
the
influence
of
the
scheme
if
an
assailant
had
occasionally
appeared
he
had
either
fired
a
random
shot
and
retreated
or
found
in
the
inefficiency
of
the
society
the
only
cause
for
hostility
it
was
at
this
crisis
and
with
such
an
array
of
motives
before
me
to
bias
my
judgment
that
i
resolved
to
make
a
close
and
candid
examination
of
the
subject
i
went
first
of
all
to
the
fountain
head
to
the
african
repository
and
the
reports
of
the
society
i
was
not
long
in
discovering
sentiments
which
seemed
to
me
as
abhorrent
to
humanity
as
contrary
to
reason
i
perused
page
after
page
first
with
perplexity
then
with
astonishment
and
finally
with
indignation
i
found
little
else
than
sinful
palliations
fatal
concessions
vain
expectations
exaggerated
statements
unfriendly
representations
glaring
contradictions
naked
terrors
deceptive
assurances
unrelenting
prejudices
and
unchristian
denunciations
i
collected
together
the
publications
of
auxiliary
societies
in
order
to
discern
some
redeeming
traits
but
i
found
them
marred
and
disfigured
with
the
same
disgusting
details
i
courted
the
acquaintance
of
eminent
colonizationists
that
i
might
learn
how
far
their
private
sentiments
agreed
with
those
which
were
so
offensive
in
print
and
i
found
no
dissimilarity
between
them
i
listened
to
discourses
from
the
pulpit
in
favor
of
the
society
and
the
same
moral
obliquities
were
seen
in
minister
and
people
these
discoveries
affected
my
mind
so
deeply
that
i
could
not
rest
i
endeavored
to
explain
away
the
meaning
of
plain
and
obvious
language
i
made
liberal
concessions
for
good
motives
and
unsuspicious
confidence
i
resorted
to
many
expedients
to
vindicate
the
disinterested
benevolence
of
the
society
but
i
could
not
rest
the
sun
in
its
splendor
was
not
more
clear
and
palpable
to
my
vision
than
the
and
character
of
this
association
it
was
evident
to
me
that
the
great
mass
of
its
supporters
at
the
north
did
not
realise
its
dangerous
tendency
they
were
told
that
it
was
designed
to
effect
the
ultimate
emancipation
of
the
slaves
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
free
people
of
color
to
abolish
the
foreign
slave
trade
to
reclaim
and
evangelize
benighted
africa
and
various
other
marvels
anxious
to
do
something
for
the
colored
population
they
knew
not
what
and
having
no
other
plan
presented
to
their
view
they
eagerly
embraced
a
scheme
which
was
so
big
with
promise
and
which
required
of
them
nothing
but
a
small
contribution
annually
perceiving
the
fatality
of
this
delusion
i
was
urged
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
attempt
its
removal
i
could
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
cries
of
the
slaves
nor
throw
off
the
obligations
which
my
creator
had
fastened
upon
me
yet
in
view
of
the
inequalities
of
the
contest
of
the
obstacles
which
towered
like
mountains
in
my
path
and
of
my
own
littleness
i
trembled
and
exclaimed
in
the
language
of
jeremiah
lord
god
behold
i
can
not
speak
for
i
am
a
child
but
i
was
immediately
strengthened
by
these
interrogations
any
thing
too
hard
for
the
lord
is
error
though
unwittingly
supported
by
a
host
of
good
men
stronger
than
truth
are
right
and
wrong
convertible
terms
dependant
upon
popular
opinion
oh
no
then
i
will
go
forward
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
of
hosts
in
the
name
of
truth
and
under
the
banner
of
right
as
it
is
not
by
might
nor
by
power
but
by
the
spirit
of
god
that
great
moral
changes
are
effected
i
am
encouraged
to
fight
valiantly
in
this
good
cause
believing
that
i
shall
off
conqueror
and
more
than
conqueror
yet
not
i
but
truth
and
justice
it
is
in
such
a
contest
that
one
shall
chase
a
thousand
and
two
put
ten
thousand
to
flight
lord
disappointeth
the
devices
of
the
crafty
so
that
their
hands
can
not
perform
their
enterprise
he
taketh
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness
and
the
counsel
of
the
froward
is
carried
headlong
the
foolishness
of
god
is
wiser
than
men
and
the
weakness
of
god
is
stronger
than
men
little
boldness
is
needed
to
assail
the
opinions
and
practices
of
notoriously
wicked
men
but
to
rebuke
great
and
good
men
for
their
conduct
and
to
impeach
their
discernment
is
the
highest
effort
of
moral
courage
the
great
mass
of
mankind
shun
the
labor
and
responsibility
of
forming
opinions
for
themselves
the
question
is
not
what
is
true
but
what
is
popular
not
what
does
god
say
but
what
says
the
public
not
what
is
my
opinion
but
what
do
others
believe
if
people
would
pin
their
faith
upon
the
bible
and
not
upon
the
sleeves
of
their
neighbors
half
of
the
heresies
in
the
world
would
instantly
disappear
if
they
would
use
their
own
eyes
their
own
ears
their
own
understandings
instead
of
the
eyes
and
ears
and
understandings
of
others
imbecility
credulity
and
folly
would
be
as
rare
as
they
are
now
common
in
community
but
unhappily
to
borrow
the
words
of
ganganelli
a
large
majority
of
mankind
are
abortions
calling
themselves
rational
and
intelligent
beings
they
act
as
if
they
had
neither
brains
nor
conscience
and
as
if
there
were
no
god
no
accountability
no
heaven
no
hell
no
eternity
minister
says
one
a
most
worthy
man
he
supports
this
society
therefore
it
is
a
good
institution
of
all
denominations
are
enlisted
in
this
enterprise
says
another
it
can
not
be
wrong
you
think
says
a
third
honest
godly
men
would
countenance
a
scheme
which
is
not
really
benevolent
but
it
is
unwise
for
beings
who
are
accountable
only
to
god
to
reason
in
this
manner
all
the
good
men
upon
earth
can
not
make
persecution
benevolence
nor
injustice
equity
and
until
they
become
infallible
implicit
reliance
upon
their
judgment
is
criminal
ministers
and
christians
a
few
years
since
were
engaged
in
the
use
and
sale
of
ardent
spirits
they
were
all
and
they
now
acknowledge
their
error
at
the
present
day
a
large
proportion
of
the
professed
disciples
of
the
prince
of
peace
maintain
the
lawfulness
of
defensive
war
and
the
right
of
the
oppressed
to
fight
and
kill
for
liberty
but
they
hold
this
sentiment
in
direct
opposition
to
the
precepts
of
their
leader
say
unto
you
which
hear
love
your
enemies
do
good
to
them
which
hate
you
bless
them
that
curse
you
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
surely
time
is
come
that
judgment
must
begin
at
the
house
of
god
i
must
pause
for
a
moment
and
count
the
number
of
those
with
whom
i
am
about
to
conflict
if
i
had
to
encounter
only
and
slaveholders
victory
would
be
easy
but
it
is
not
the
south
alone
that
is
to
be
subdued
the
whole
nation
is
against
me
church
after
church
is
to
be
converted
and
the
powerful
influence
of
the
clergy
broken
the
friendship
of
good
men
is
to
be
turned
into
enmity
and
their
support
into
opposition
it
is
my
task
to
change
their
admiration
into
abhorrence
to
convince
them
that
their
exertions
have
been
misdirected
and
productive
of
greater
evil
than
good
and
to
induce
them
to
abandon
an
institution
to
which
they
now
fondly
cling
to
those
who
neither
fear
god
nor
regard
man
who
have
sworn
eternal
animosity
to
their
colored
countrymen
and
whose
cry
is
with
them
we
do
not
want
them
here
i
make
no
appeal
disregarding
as
they
do
that
divine
command
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
it
would
be
idle
for
me
to
direct
my
arguments
to
them
i
address
myself
to
and
honorable
men
whose
heads
and
hearts
are
susceptible
to
the
force
of
sound
logic
i
appeal
to
those
who
have
been
redeemed
from
the
bondage
of
sin
by
the
precious
blood
of
christ
and
with
whom
i
hope
to
unite
in
a
better
world
in
ascribing
glory
and
honor
and
praise
to
the
great
deliverer
for
ever
if
i
can
succeed
in
gaining
their
attention
i
feel
sure
of
convincing
their
understandings
and
securing
their
support
besides
the
overwhelming
odds
which
are
opposed
to
me
i
labor
under
other
very
serious
disadvantages
my
efforts
in
the
cause
of
emancipation
have
been
received
as
if
they
were
intended
to
bring
chaos
back
again
and
to
give
the
land
up
to
pillage
and
its
inhabitants
to
slaughter
my
calls
for
an
alteration
in
the
feelings
and
practices
of
the
people
toward
the
blacks
have
been
regarded
as
requiring
a
sacrifice
of
all
the
rules
of
propriety
and
as
seeking
an
overthrow
of
the
established
laws
of
nature
i
have
been
thrust
into
prison
and
amerced
in
a
heavy
fine
epithets
huge
and
unseemly
have
been
showered
upon
me
without
mercy
i
have
been
branded
as
a
fanatic
a
madman
a
disturber
of
the
peace
an
incendiary
a
cutthroat
a
monster
assassination
has
been
threatened
me
in
a
multitude
of
anonymous
letters
private
and
public
rewards
to
a
very
large
amount
by
combinations
of
individuals
and
by
legislative
bodies
at
the
south
have
been
offered
to
any
persons
who
shall
abduct
or
destroy
me
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
this
malignity
of
opposition
and
proximity
of
danger
however
are
like
oil
to
the
fire
of
my
zeal
i
am
not
deliriously
enthusiastic
i
do
not
covet
to
be
a
martyr
but
i
had
rather
die
a
thousand
deaths
than
witness
the
horrible
oppression
under
which
more
than
two
millions
of
my
countrymen
groan
be
no
reproaches
no
dangers
shall
deter
me
at
the
north
or
the
south
at
the
east
or
the
west
wherever
providence
may
call
me
my
voice
shall
be
heard
in
behalf
of
the
perishing
slave
and
against
the
claims
of
his
oppressor
mine
is
the
frank
avowal
of
the
excellent
wilberforce
i
can
admit
of
no
compromise
when
the
commands
of
equity
and
philanthropy
are
so
imperious
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
blood
that
may
be
spilled
i
protest
against
the
system
as
the
most
flagrant
violation
of
every
principle
of
justice
and
humanity
i
never
will
desert
the
cause
in
my
task
it
is
impossible
to
tire
it
fills
my
mind
with
complacency
and
peace
at
night
i
lie
down
with
composure
and
rise
to
it
in
the
morning
with
alacrity
i
never
will
desist
from
this
blessed
work
now
that
the
concentrated
execration
of
the
civilized
world
is
poured
upon
those
who
engage
in
the
foreign
slave
trade
how
mild
and
inefficient
comparatively
speaking
seem
to
have
been
the
rebukes
of
pitt
and
fox
and
wilberforce
and
clarkson
yet
these
rebukes
were
once
deemed
fanatical
and
outrageous
by
good
men
yea
like
flames
of
fire
threatening
a
universal
conflagration
so
the
denunciations
which
i
am
now
hurling
against
slavery
and
its
abettors
which
seem
to
many
so
violent
and
unmerited
will
be
considered
moderate
pertinent
and
just
when
this
murderous
system
shall
have
been
overthrown
fanaticism
has
been
the
crime
alleged
against
reformers
in
all
ages
it
was
said
of
the
apostles
have
turned
the
world
upside
down
come
hither
also
luther
was
a
madman
in
his
day
what
is
he
now
in
the
estimation
of
the
friends
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
one
of
starry
lights
of
virtue
that
diffuse
through
the
dark
depths
of
time
their
vivid
flame
that
base
and
desperate
men
should
thus
stigmatize
those
who
endure
the
cross
as
good
soldiers
and
walk
as
pilgrims
and
strangers
here
is
not
wonderful
but
that
the
professed
followers
of
jesus
christ
should
join
in
this
is
lamentable
singular
enough
i
have
been
almost
as
cruelly
aspersed
by
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
church
members
as
by
any
other
class
of
men
unacquainted
with
me
and
ignorant
of
my
sentiments
they
have
readily
believed
the
accusations
of
my
enemies
the
introduction
of
my
name
into
conversation
has
elicited
from
them
contemptuous
sneers
or
strong
denunciations
i
have
a
right
to
complain
of
this
treatment
and
i
do
strongly
protest
against
it
as
unchristian
hurtful
and
ungenerous
to
prejudge
and
condemn
an
individual
on
vague
and
apocryphal
rumors
without
listening
to
his
defence
or
examining
evidence
is
tyranny
perhaps
i
am
in
error
perhaps
i
deserve
unqualified
condemnation
but
i
am
at
least
entitled
to
a
privilege
which
is
granted
to
the
vilest
criminals
namely
the
privilege
of
a
fair
trial
i
ask
nothing
more
to
accuse
me
of
heresy
madness
and
sedition
is
one
thing
to
substantiate
the
accusation
another
should
this
work
chance
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
who
have
thus
ignorantly
reprobated
my
course
i
appeal
to
their
sense
of
rectitude
whether
they
are
not
bound
to
give
it
a
candid
and
deliberate
perusal
and
if
they
shall
find
in
my
writings
nothing
contrary
to
the
immutable
principles
of
justice
whether
they
ought
not
to
be
as
strenuous
in
my
defence
as
they
have
been
hitherto
in
seeking
my
overthrow
to
show
that
i
do
not
vacate
any
pledge
which
i
have
given
to
the
public
i
shall
here
insert
all
the
specifications
which
from
time
to
time
i
have
brought
against
the
american
colonization
society
in
liberator
of
april
is
the
following
serious
compend
am
prepared
to
show
that
those
who
have
entered
into
this
conspiracy
against
human
rights
are
unanimous
in
abusing
their
victims
unanimous
in
their
mode
of
attack
unanimous
in
proclaiming
the
absurdity
that
our
free
blacks
are
natives
of
africa
unanimous
in
propagating
the
libel
that
they
can
not
be
elevated
and
improved
in
this
country
unanimous
in
opposing
their
instruction
unanimous
in
exciting
the
prejudices
of
the
people
against
them
unanimous
in
apologising
for
the
crime
of
slavery
unanimous
in
conceding
the
right
of
the
planters
to
hold
their
slaves
in
a
limited
bondage
unanimous
in
their
hollow
pretence
for
colonizing
namely
to
evangelize
africa
unanimous
in
their
for
the
measure
a
terror
lest
the
blacks
should
rise
to
avenge
their
accumulated
wrongs
it
is
a
conspiracy
to
send
the
free
people
of
color
to
africa
under
a
benevolent
pretence
but
really
that
the
slaves
may
be
held
more
securely
in
bondage
it
is
a
conspiracy
based
upon
fear
oppression
and
falsehood
which
draws
its
aliment
from
the
prejudices
of
the
people
which
is
sustained
by
duplicity
which
really
upholds
the
slave
system
which
fascinates
while
it
destroys
which
endangers
the
safety
and
happiness
of
the
country
which
no
precept
of
the
bible
can
justify
which
is
implacable
in
its
spirit
which
should
be
annihilated
at
a
blow
are
my
accusations
and
if
i
do
not
substantiate
them
i
am
willing
to
be
covered
with
reproach
the
following
is
copied
from
an
editorial
article
of
july
superstructure
of
the
colonization
society
rests
upon
the
following
pillars
it
declares
that
the
whole
colored
population
must
be
removed
to
africa
but
as
the
free
portion
are
almost
opposed
to
a
removal
it
seems
to
be
the
determination
of
the
society
to
make
their
situations
so
uncomfortable
and
degraded
here
as
to
compel
them
to
migrate
consequently
it
discourages
their
education
and
improvement
in
this
their
native
home
this
is
persecution
it
stigmatises
our
colored
citizens
as
being
natives
of
africa
and
talks
of
sending
them
to
their
native
land
when
they
are
no
more
related
to
africa
than
we
are
to
great
britain
it
avows
as
a
prominent
reason
why
colored
citizens
ought
to
be
removed
that
their
continuance
among
us
will
be
dangerous
to
us
as
a
people
this
is
a
libel
upon
their
character
instead
of
demanding
justice
for
this
oppressed
class
the
society
calls
for
their
removal
it
boldly
denies
that
there
is
power
enough
in
the
gospel
to
melt
down
the
prejudices
of
men
and
insists
that
so
long
as
the
people
of
color
remain
among
us
must
be
their
enemies
every
honest
man
should
abhor
the
doctrine
in
liberator
of
july
alluding
to
the
present
work
i
used
the
following
language
shall
be
willing
to
stake
my
reputation
upon
it
for
honesty
prudence
benevolence
truth
and
sagacity
if
i
do
not
prove
the
colonization
society
to
be
a
creature
without
heart
without
brains
eyeless
unnatural
hypocritical
relentless
unjust
then
nothing
is
capable
of
demonstration
then
let
me
be
covered
with
confusion
of
face
the
following
paragraph
is
extracted
from
liberator
of
november
is
the
enemy
of
immediate
restitution
to
the
slaves
it
courts
and
receives
the
approbation
of
notorious
slave
owners
it
deprecates
any
interference
with
slave
property
it
discourages
the
improvement
of
the
colored
population
except
they
are
removed
to
the
shores
of
africa
it
is
lulling
the
country
into
a
fatal
sleep
pretending
to
be
something
when
it
is
nothing
it
is
utterly
chimerical
as
well
as
intolerant
in
its
design
it
serves
to
increase
the
value
of
the
slaves
and
to
make
brisk
the
foreign
and
domestic
slave
trade
it
nourishes
and
justifies
the
most
cruel
prejudices
against
color
it
sneers
at
those
who
advocate
the
bestowal
of
equal
rights
upon
our
colored
countrymen
it
contends
for
an
indefinite
dilatory
emancipation
it
expressly
declares
that
it
is
more
humane
to
keep
the
slaves
in
chains
than
to
give
them
freedom
in
this
country
in
short
it
is
the
most
compendious
and
best
adapted
scheme
to
uphold
the
slave
system
that
human
ingenuity
can
invent
moreover
it
is
utterly
and
irreconcileably
opposed
to
the
wishes
and
sentiments
of
the
great
body
of
the
free
people
of
color
repeatedly
expressed
in
the
most
public
manner
but
cruelly
disregarded
by
it
the
following
passages
are
taken
from
my
address
to
the
people
of
color
delivered
in
various
places
in
june
me
briefly
examine
the
doctrines
of
colonizationists
they
generally
agree
in
publishing
the
misstatement
that
you
are
strangers
and
foreigners
surely
they
know
better
they
know
that
as
a
body
you
are
no
more
natives
of
africa
than
they
themselves
are
natives
of
great
britain
yet
they
repeat
the
absurd
charge
and
they
do
so
in
order
to
cover
their
crusade
but
suppose
you
were
foreigners
would
such
an
accident
justify
this
persecution
and
removal
and
if
so
then
all
foreigners
must
come
under
the
same
ban
and
must
prepare
to
depart
there
would
be
in
that
case
a
most
alarming
deduction
from
our
population
suppose
a
philanthropic
and
religious
crusade
were
got
up
against
the
dutch
the
french
the
swiss
the
irish
among
us
to
remove
them
to
new
holland
to
enlighten
and
civilize
her
cannibals
who
would
not
laugh
at
the
scheme
who
would
not
actively
oppose
it
would
any
one
blame
the
above
classes
for
steadfastly
resisting
it
just
so
then
in
regard
to
african
colonization
but
our
colored
population
are
not
aliens
they
were
born
on
our
soil
they
are
bone
of
our
bone
and
flesh
of
our
flesh
their
fathers
fought
bravely
to
achieve
our
independence
during
the
revolutionary
war
without
immediate
or
subsequent
compensation
they
spilt
their
blood
freely
during
the
last
war
they
are
entitled
in
fact
to
every
inch
of
our
southern
and
much
of
our
western
territory
having
worn
themselves
out
in
its
cultivation
and
received
nothing
but
wounds
and
bruises
in
return
are
these
the
men
to
stigmatize
as
foreigners
generally
agree
in
asserting
that
the
people
of
color
can
not
be
elevated
in
this
country
nor
be
admitted
to
equal
privileges
with
the
whites
is
not
this
a
libel
upon
humanity
and
justice
a
libel
upon
republicanism
a
libel
upon
the
declaration
of
independence
a
libel
upon
christianity
all
men
are
born
equal
and
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
among
which
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
declaration
that
men
possess
these
rights
whether
they
are
six
feet
five
inches
high
or
three
feet
two
and
a
half
whether
they
weigh
three
hundred
or
one
hundred
pounds
whether
they
parade
in
broadcloth
or
flutter
in
rags
whether
their
skins
are
jet
black
or
lily
white
whether
their
hair
is
straight
or
woolly
auburn
or
red
black
or
gray
does
it
not
we
who
are
present
differ
from
each
other
in
our
looks
in
our
color
in
height
and
in
bulk
we
have
all
shades
and
aspects
and
sizes
now
would
it
not
be
and
for
us
to
quarrel
about
sitting
on
this
seat
or
that
because
this
complexion
is
too
dark
or
that
man
looks
are
too
ugly
and
to
put
others
out
of
the
house
because
they
happen
to
be
ignorant
or
poor
or
helpless
to
commit
this
violence
would
be
evidently
wrong
then
to
do
it
in
a
large
assemblage
in
a
community
in
a
state
or
in
a
nation
it
is
equally
unjust
but
is
not
this
the
colonization
principle
who
are
the
individuals
that
applaud
that
justify
that
advocate
this
exclusion
who
are
they
that
venture
to
tell
the
american
people
that
they
have
neither
honesty
enough
nor
patriotism
enough
nor
morality
enough
nor
religion
enough
to
treat
their
colored
brethren
as
countrymen
and
citizens
some
of
them
i
am
sorry
to
say
are
professedly
ministers
of
the
gospel
others
are
christian
professors
others
are
judges
and
lawyers
others
are
our
senators
and
representatives
others
are
editors
of
newspapers
these
ministers
and
christians
dishonor
the
gospel
which
they
profess
these
judges
and
lawyers
are
the
men
spoken
of
by
the
saviour
who
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
borne
and
lay
them
on
men
shoulders
but
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
fingers
these
senators
and
representatives
ought
not
to
receive
the
suffrages
of
the
people
these
editors
are
unworthy
of
public
patronage
too
generally
agree
in
discouraging
your
instruction
and
elevation
at
home
they
pretend
that
ignorance
is
bliss
and
therefore
is
folly
to
be
wise
they
pretend
that
knowledge
is
a
dangerous
thing
in
the
head
of
a
colored
man
they
pretend
that
you
have
no
ambition
they
pretend
that
you
have
no
brains
in
fine
they
pretend
a
thousand
other
absurd
things
they
are
a
combination
of
pretences
what
tyranny
is
this
shutting
up
the
human
intellect
binding
with
chains
the
inward
man
and
perpetuating
ignorance
may
we
not
address
them
in
the
language
of
christ
wo
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
shut
up
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
men
for
ye
neither
go
in
yourselves
neither
suffer
ye
them
that
are
entering
to
go
in
ye
pay
tithe
of
mint
and
anise
and
cummin
and
have
omitted
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
judgment
mercy
and
faith
generally
agree
in
apologising
for
the
crime
of
slavery
they
get
behind
the
contemptible
subterfuge
that
it
was
entailed
upon
the
planters
as
if
the
continuance
of
the
horrid
system
were
not
criminal
as
if
the
robberies
of
another
generation
justify
the
robberies
of
the
present
as
if
the
slaves
had
not
an
inalienable
right
to
freedom
as
if
slavery
were
not
an
individual
as
well
as
a
national
crime
as
if
the
tearing
asunder
families
limb
from
limb
branding
the
flesh
with
red
hot
irons
mangling
the
body
with
whips
and
knives
feeding
it
on
husks
and
clothing
it
with
rags
crushing
the
intellect
and
destroying
the
soul
as
if
such
inconceivable
cruelty
were
not
chargeable
to
those
who
inflict
it
to
the
effect
of
colonization
upon
slavery
it
is
rather
favorable
than
injurious
to
the
system
now
and
then
indeed
there
is
a
great
flourish
of
trumpets
and
glowing
accounts
of
the
willingness
of
planters
to
emancipate
their
slaves
on
condition
of
transportation
to
africa
now
and
then
a
slave
is
actually
manumitted
and
removed
and
the
incident
is
dwelt
upon
for
months
why
my
friends
hundreds
of
slaves
are
annually
turned
off
to
die
like
old
horses
no
doubt
their
masters
will
thank
the
colonization
society
or
any
one
else
to
send
them
out
of
the
country
especially
as
they
will
gain
much
glorification
in
the
newspapers
for
their
sacrifices
let
no
man
be
deceived
by
these
manoeuvres
time
is
consumed
and
yet
i
have
scarcely
entered
upon
the
threshold
of
my
argument
now
what
a
spectacle
is
presented
to
the
world
the
american
people
boasting
of
their
free
and
equal
rights
of
their
abhorrence
of
aristocratical
distinctions
of
their
republican
equality
proclaiming
on
every
wind
that
all
men
are
born
and
endowed
with
certain
inalienable
and
that
this
land
is
an
asylum
for
the
persecuted
of
all
nations
and
yet
as
loudly
proclaiming
that
they
are
determined
to
deprive
millions
of
their
own
countrymen
of
every
political
and
social
right
and
to
send
them
to
a
barbarous
continent
because
the
creator
has
given
them
a
sable
complexion
where
exists
a
more
rigorous
despotism
what
conspiracy
was
ever
more
cruel
what
hypocrisy
and
tergiversation
so
enormous
the
story
is
proclaimed
in
our
pulpits
in
our
state
and
national
assemblies
in
courts
of
law
in
religious
and
secular
periodicals
among
all
parties
and
in
all
quarters
of
the
country
that
there
is
a
in
the
people
to
do
justly
love
mercy
and
to
walk
uprightly
that
they
must
always
be
the
enemies
and
oppressors
of
the
colored
people
that
no
love
of
liberty
no
dictate
of
duty
no
precept
of
republicanism
no
dread
of
retribution
no
claim
of
right
no
injunction
of
the
gospel
can
possibly
persuade
them
to
do
unto
their
colored
countrymen
as
they
would
that
they
should
do
unto
them
in
a
reversal
of
circumstances
now
to
these
promulgators
of
unrighteousness
with
the
declaration
of
independence
in
one
hand
and
the
bible
in
the
other
i
fearlessly
give
battle
rich
and
mighty
and
numerous
as
they
are
by
the
help
of
the
lord
i
will
put
them
to
open
shame
they
shall
not
libel
me
they
shall
not
libel
my
country
with
impunity
they
shall
not
make
our
boasted
republicanism
a
and
a
hissing
among
all
nations
nor
sink
the
christian
religion
below
heathen
idolatry
and
if
they
persist
in
publishing
their
scandalous
proclamations
they
shall
be
labelled
as
the
enemies
of
their
species
and
of
the
republic
and
treated
accordingly
colonization
society
therefore
instead
of
being
a
philanthropic
and
religious
institution
is
and
in
its
tendency
its
pretences
are
false
its
doctrines
odious
its
means
contemptible
if
we
are
to
send
away
the
colored
population
because
they
are
profligate
and
vicious
what
sort
of
missionaries
will
they
make
why
not
send
away
the
vicious
among
the
whites
for
the
same
reason
and
the
same
purpose
if
ignorance
be
a
crime
where
shall
we
begin
to
select
how
much
must
a
man
know
to
save
him
from
transportation
how
white
must
he
be
if
we
send
away
a
mixed
breed
how
many
will
be
left
if
foreigners
only
then
the
people
of
color
must
remain
for
they
are
our
countrymen
would
foreigners
submit
no
not
for
an
instant
why
should
the
american
people
make
this
enormous
expenditure
of
life
and
money
why
not
use
the
funds
of
the
society
to
instruct
and
elevate
our
colored
population
at
home
this
would
be
rational
and
serviceable
instead
of
removing
men
from
a
land
of
civilization
and
knowledge
of
schools
and
seminaries
and
colleges
to
give
them
instruction
in
a
land
of
darkness
and
desolation
would
it
not
be
wiser
and
better
to
reverse
the
case
and
bring
the
ignorant
here
for
cultivation
the
foregoing
accusations
are
grave
weighty
positive
involving
a
perilous
responsibility
and
requiring
ample
and
irrefragable
proof
they
are
expressed
in
vehement
terms
but
to
measure
the
propriety
of
language
we
must
first
examine
the
character
of
the
system
or
the
nature
of
the
object
against
which
it
is
directed
if
we
see
a
person
wilfully
abusing
the
goods
of
an
individual
we
may
reprehend
him
but
with
comparative
mildness
if
we
see
him
maiming
or
in
any
way
maltreating
another
man
cattle
we
may
increase
the
severity
of
our
rebuke
but
if
we
see
him
violating
all
the
social
and
sacred
relations
of
life
daily
defrauding
a
number
of
his
fellow
creatures
of
the
fruits
of
their
toil
calling
them
his
property
selling
them
for
money
lacerating
their
bodies
and
ruining
their
souls
we
may
use
the
strongest
terms
of
moral
indignation
nor
is
plain
and
vehement
denunciation
of
crime
inconsistent
with
the
most
benevolent
feelings
towards
the
perpetrators
of
it
we
are
sustained
in
these
positions
by
the
example
of
christ
and
the
apostles
and
the
prophets
and
the
reformers
so
also
if
there
be
an
institution
the
direct
tendency
of
which
is
to
perpetuate
slavery
to
encourage
persecution
and
to
invigorate
prejudice
although
many
of
its
supporters
may
be
actuated
by
pure
motives
it
ought
to
receive
unqualified
condemnation
it
is
proper
to
call
things
by
their
right
names
what
does
the
law
term
him
who
steals
your
or
breaks
into
your
dwelling
or
strips
you
on
the
highway
a
robber
is
the
charge
inflammatory
or
unjust
or
will
it
please
the
villain
the
abuse
of
language
is
seen
only
in
its
misapplication
those
who
object
to
the
strength
of
my
denunciation
must
prove
its
perversion
before
they
accuse
me
of
injustice
probably
i
may
be
interrogated
by
individuals
do
you
object
to
a
colony
in
africa
are
you
not
willing
people
should
choose
their
own
places
of
residence
and
if
the
blacks
are
willing
to
remove
why
throw
obstacles
in
their
path
or
deprecate
their
withdrawal
all
go
of
what
then
do
you
complain
is
not
the
colony
at
liberia
in
a
flourishing
condition
and
expanding
beyond
the
most
sanguine
expectations
of
its
founders
pertinent
questions
deserve
pertinent
answers
i
say
then
in
reply
that
i
do
not
object
to
a
colony
the
to
use
the
popular
phraseology
of
the
day
in
other
words
i
am
entirely
willing
men
should
be
as
free
as
the
birds
in
choosing
the
time
when
the
mode
how
and
the
place
where
they
shall
migrate
the
power
of
locomotion
was
given
to
be
used
at
will
as
beings
of
intelligence
and
enterprise
world
is
all
before
them
where
to
choose
their
place
of
rest
and
providence
their
guide
the
emigration
from
to
the
far
west
is
constant
and
large
almost
every
city
town
or
village
suffers
annually
by
the
departure
of
some
of
its
adventurous
inhabitants
companies
have
been
formed
to
go
and
possess
the
oregon
territory
an
enterprise
hazardous
and
unpromising
in
the
extreme
the
old
states
are
distributing
their
population
over
the
whole
continent
with
unexampled
fruitfulness
and
liberality
but
why
this
restless
roving
unsatisfied
disposition
is
it
because
those
who
cherish
it
are
treated
as
the
offscouring
of
all
flesh
in
the
place
of
their
birth
or
because
they
do
not
possess
equal
rights
and
privileges
with
other
citizens
or
because
they
are
the
victims
of
incorrigible
hate
and
prejudice
or
because
they
are
told
that
they
must
choose
between
exilement
and
perpetual
degradation
or
because
the
density
of
population
renders
it
impossible
for
them
to
obtain
preferment
and
competence
here
or
because
they
are
estranged
by
oppression
and
scorn
or
because
they
cherish
no
attachment
to
their
native
soil
to
the
scenes
of
their
childhood
and
youth
or
to
the
institutions
of
government
or
because
they
consider
themselves
as
dwellers
in
a
strange
land
and
feel
a
burning
desire
a
feverish
longing
to
return
home
no
they
lie
under
no
odious
disabilities
whether
imposed
by
public
opinion
or
by
legislative
power
to
them
the
path
of
preferment
is
wide
open
they
sustain
a
solid
and
honorable
reputation
they
not
only
can
rise
but
have
risen
and
may
soar
still
higher
to
responsible
stations
and
affluent
circumstances
no
calamity
afflicts
no
burden
depresses
no
reproach
excludes
no
despondency
enfeebles
them
and
they
love
the
spot
of
their
nativity
almost
to
idolatry
the
air
of
heaven
is
not
freer
or
more
buoyant
than
they
theirs
is
a
spirit
of
curiosity
and
adventurous
enterprise
impelled
by
no
malignant
influences
but
by
the
spontaneous
promptings
of
the
mind
far
different
is
the
case
of
our
colored
population
their
banishment
is
they
are
to
turn
as
will
be
shown
in
other
parts
of
this
work
the
following
proposition
is
the
success
of
an
enterprise
furnishes
no
proof
that
it
is
in
accordance
with
justice
or
that
it
meets
the
approbation
of
god
or
that
it
ought
to
be
prosecuted
to
its
consummation
or
that
it
is
the
fruit
of
disinterested
benevolence
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
colony
at
liberia
by
a
prodigal
expenditure
of
life
and
money
will
ultimately
flourish
but
a
good
result
would
no
more
hallow
that
persecution
which
is
seeking
to
drag
the
blacks
away
than
it
would
if
we
should
burn
every
distillery
and
shut
up
in
prison
every
vender
of
ardent
spirits
in
order
to
do
good
and
to
prevent
people
from
becoming
drunkards
because
jehovah
overrules
evil
for
good
shall
we
therefore
continue
to
do
evil
if
ten
thousand
white
mechanics
farmers
merchants
were
to
emigrate
to
africa
does
any
man
doubt
whether
permanent
good
would
result
from
the
enterprise
good
to
that
benighted
continent
which
would
counterbalance
all
the
sacrifices
and
sufferings
attending
it
and
yet
is
there
a
single
mechanic
farmer
or
merchant
who
feels
it
to
be
his
duty
or
would
be
willing
to
go
suppose
the
people
of
color
should
get
the
power
into
their
hands
and
should
argue
that
the
whites
must
not
be
admitted
to
equal
privileges
with
themselves
but
that
having
so
long
plundered
africa
and
oppressed
her
children
justice
demanded
that
they
should
be
sent
to
that
desolate
land
to
build
up
colonies
and
carry
the
light
of
civilization
and
knowledge
as
a
sort
of
reparation
and
that
having
superior
instruction
in
literature
and
science
they
were
peculiarly
qualified
for
such
a
mission
how
would
this
doctrine
relish
is
a
poor
rule
that
will
not
work
both
ways
says
the
proverb
yet
this
logic
would
be
more
sound
than
is
our
own
with
regard
to
the
colonization
of
the
blacks
on
this
point
deception
is
practised
to
a
great
extent
the
advocates
of
the
colonization
society
are
constantly
aiming
to
divert
public
attention
from
the
only
proper
subject
of
inquiry
namely
it
based
upon
benevolence
and
justice
to
the
success
of
the
colony
granting
all
that
they
assert
it
proves
nothing
but
of
this
success
i
shall
have
occasion
doubtless
to
speak
hereafter
fine
stories
are
trumpeted
all
over
the
country
of
the
happiness
intelligence
industry
virtue
enterprise
and
dignity
of
the
colonists
and
changes
absolutely
miraculous
are
gravely
recorded
for
the
admiration
and
credulity
of
community
simple
says
solomon
every
word
but
the
prudent
man
looketh
well
to
his
going
the
doctrine
that
the
sanctifies
the
means
belongs
i
trust
exclusively
to
the
creed
of
the
jesuits
if
i
were
sure
that
the
society
would
accomplish
the
entire
regeneration
of
africa
by
its
present
measures
my
detestation
of
its
principles
would
not
abate
one
jot
nor
would
i
bestow
upon
it
the
smallest
modicum
of
praise
never
shall
the
fruits
of
the
mercy
and
overruling
providence
of
god
ever
bringing
good
out
of
evil
and
light
out
of
darkness
be
ascribed
to
the
prejudice
and
sin
of
man
it
is
certain
that
many
a
poor
native
african
has
been
led
to
embrace
the
gospel
in
consequence
of
his
transportation
to
our
shores
who
else
had
lived
and
died
a
heathen
is
the
slave
trade
therefore
a
blessing
suppose
one
of
those
wretches
who
are
engaged
in
this
nefarious
commerce
were
brought
before
the
supreme
court
and
being
convicted
should
be
asked
by
the
judge
whether
he
had
aught
to
say
why
sentence
of
death
should
not
be
pronounced
upon
him
and
suppose
the
culprit
should
espy
some
of
his
sable
victims
in
court
whom
he
knew
had
made
a
profession
of
faith
and
he
should
boldly
reply
it
please
your
honor
i
abducted
these
people
away
from
their
homes
it
is
true
but
they
were
poor
miserable
benighted
idolators
and
must
have
inevitably
remained
as
such
unto
the
hour
of
their
death
if
i
had
not
brought
them
to
this
land
of
christianity
and
bibles
where
they
have
been
taught
a
knowledge
of
the
true
god
and
are
now
rejoicing
in
hope
of
a
glorious
immortality
i
therefore
offer
as
a
conclusive
reason
why
sentence
should
not
be
pronounced
i
have
rescued
souls
from
and
thus
enlarged
the
company
of
the
saints
in
light
would
the
villain
be
acquitted
and
instead
of
a
halter
receive
the
panegyric
of
the
court
for
his
conduct
our
pilgrim
fathers
not
being
able
to
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
own
consciences
in
the
mother
country
were
compelled
by
ecclesiastical
despotism
to
seek
a
refuge
in
this
rude
and
barbarous
continent
wonderful
have
been
the
fruits
of
their
expulsion
a
mighty
republic
established
the
freest
the
wisest
the
most
religious
on
earth
influencing
the
world
by
its
example
and
exciting
the
emulation
of
all
nations
now
suppose
we
should
occasionally
find
in
the
pages
of
the
edinburgh
or
quarterly
review
or
in
the
columns
of
the
english
newspapers
not
only
a
full
justification
of
this
oppressive
treatment
in
view
of
its
astonishing
consequences
but
a
claim
to
approbation
on
account
of
its
exercise
would
not
such
effrontery
amaze
us
would
not
an
honest
indignation
burn
within
us
should
we
look
with
a
more
complacent
aspect
upon
the
bigots
who
kindled
those
fires
of
persecution
around
the
puritans
which
but
for
the
interposition
of
heaven
had
consumed
them
to
ashes
the
death
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
was
essential
to
the
salvation
of
the
world
suppose
judas
at
the
judgment
day
should
build
upon
this
fact
in
extenuation
of
his
dreadful
crime
what
would
be
the
decision
of
the
assembled
universe
yea
what
was
the
condemnation
passed
upon
him
by
the
illustrious
sufferer
to
that
man
by
whom
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
good
were
it
for
that
man
if
he
had
never
been
born
let
not
then
any
imaginary
or
real
prosperity
of
the
settlement
at
liberia
lead
any
individual
to
applaud
the
colonization
society
reckless
whether
it
be
actuated
by
mistaken
philanthropy
or
perverted
generosity
or
selfish
policy
or
unchristian
prejudice
i
should
oppose
this
society
even
were
its
doctrines
harmless
it
imperatively
and
effectually
seals
up
the
lips
of
a
vast
number
of
influential
and
pious
men
who
for
fear
of
giving
offence
to
those
slaveholders
with
whom
they
associate
and
thereby
leading
to
a
dissolution
of
the
compact
dare
not
expose
the
flagrant
enormities
of
the
system
of
slavery
nor
denounce
the
crime
of
holding
human
beings
in
bondage
they
dare
not
lead
to
the
onset
against
the
forces
of
tyranny
and
if
shrink
from
the
conflict
how
shall
the
victory
be
won
i
do
not
mean
to
aver
that
in
their
sermons
or
addresses
or
private
conversations
they
never
allude
to
the
subject
of
slavery
for
they
do
so
frequently
or
at
least
every
fourth
of
july
but
my
complaint
is
that
they
content
themselves
with
representing
slavery
as
an
evil
a
misfortune
a
calamity
which
has
been
entailed
upon
us
by
former
generations
not
as
an
crime
embracing
in
its
folds
robbery
cruelty
oppression
and
piracy
do
not
identify
the
they
make
no
direct
pungent
earnest
appeal
to
the
consciences
of
by
consenting
to
walk
with
them
they
virtually
agree
to
abstain
from
all
offensive
remarks
and
to
aim
entirely
at
the
expulsion
of
the
free
people
of
color
their
lugubrious
exclamations
and
solemn
animadversions
and
reproachful
reflections
are
altogether
indefinite
they
about
and
about
and
all
the
way
round
to
nothing
they
generalize
they
shoot
into
the
air
they
do
not
disturb
the
repose
nor
wound
the
complacency
of
the
sinner
have
put
no
difference
between
the
holy
and
profane
neither
have
they
shewed
difference
between
the
unclean
and
the
clean
thus
has
free
inquiry
been
suppressed
and
a
universal
fear
created
and
the
tongue
of
the
boldest
silenced
and
the
sleep
of
death
fastened
upon
the
nation
has
fallen
in
the
streets
and
equity
can
not
enter
the
plague
is
raging
with
unwonted
fatality
but
no
is
established
no
adequate
remedy
sought
the
tide
of
moral
death
is
constantly
rising
and
widening
but
no
efforts
are
made
to
stay
its
desolating
career
the
fire
of
god
indignation
is
kindling
against
us
and
thick
darkness
covers
the
heavens
and
the
hour
of
retribution
is
at
hand
but
we
are
obstinate
in
our
transgression
we
refuse
to
repent
we
impiously
throw
the
burden
of
our
guilt
upon
our
predecessors
we
affect
resignation
to
our
lot
we
descant
upon
the
mysterious
dispensations
of
providence
we
deem
ourselves
objects
of
compassion
rather
than
of
his
displeasure
i
not
visit
for
these
things
saith
the
lord
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this
were
the
american
colonization
society
bending
its
energies
directly
to
the
immediate
abolition
of
slavery
seeking
to
enlighten
and
consolidate
public
opinion
on
this
momentous
subject
faithfully
exposing
the
awful
guilt
of
the
owners
of
slaves
manfully
contending
for
the
bestowal
of
equal
rights
upon
our
free
colored
population
in
this
their
native
land
assiduously
endeavoring
to
uproot
the
prejudices
of
society
and
holding
no
fellowship
with
oppressors
my
opposition
to
it
would
cease
it
might
continue
to
bestow
its
charities
upon
those
who
should
desire
to
seek
another
country
and
at
the
same
time
launch
its
thunders
against
the
system
of
oppression
but
alas
it
looks
to
the
banishment
of
the
free
people
of
color
as
the
only
means
to
abolish
slavery
and
conciliate
the
feelings
of
the
planters
the
popularity
of
the
society
is
not
attributable
to
its
merits
but
exclusively
to
its
congeniality
with
those
unchristian
prejudices
which
have
so
long
been
cherished
against
a
sable
complexion
it
is
agreeable
to
slaveholders
because
it
is
striving
to
remove
a
class
of
persons
who
they
fear
may
stir
up
their
slaves
to
rebellion
all
who
avow
undying
hostility
to
the
people
of
color
are
in
favor
of
it
all
who
shrink
from
acknowledging
them
as
brethren
and
friends
or
who
make
them
a
distinct
and
inferior
caste
or
who
deny
the
possibility
of
elevating
them
in
the
scale
of
improvement
here
most
heartily
embrace
it
having
ample
funds
it
has
been
able
to
circulate
its
specious
appeals
in
every
part
of
the
country
and
to
employ
active
and
eloquent
agents
who
have
glowingly
described
to
the
people
the
immense
advantages
to
be
reaped
from
the
accomplishment
of
its
designs
with
this
entire
preoccupancy
of
the
ground
and
these
common
though
unworthy
dispositions
in
its
favor
the
wonder
is
that
it
is
not
more
popular
much
cleverness
is
not
requisite
to
tell
a
fine
story
and
a
fine
story
is
always
agreeable
to
a
credulous
listener
an
agent
of
the
society
goes
into
a
place
and
finds
no
difficulty
in
procuring
a
pulpit
from
which
to
address
a
congregation
the
benevolent
pastor
who
perhaps
has
had
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
examine
the
principles
of
the
society
readily
officiates
on
the
occasion
and
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
believing
that
he
is
not
asking
amiss
supplicates
the
benediction
of
heaven
upon
the
object
of
the
meeting
this
of
the
pastor
with
the
agent
makes
an
impression
decidedly
favorable
to
the
latter
upon
the
minds
of
the
audience
and
prepares
them
to
receive
his
statements
with
confidence
he
first
dwells
upon
the
miserable
condition
of
africa
desolated
with
civil
wars
the
prey
of
kidnappers
given
up
to
idolatry
full
of
intellectual
darkness
and
spiritual
death
and
bleeding
at
every
pore
he
next
depicts
the
horrors
of
the
slave
trade
and
shows
how
inefficient
have
been
the
laws
enacted
for
its
suppression
he
finally
expatiates
upon
the
evils
and
dangers
of
slavery
and
is
particularly
minute
in
describing
the
degradation
of
the
free
people
of
color
which
he
declares
to
be
irreclaimable
in
this
land
of
gospel
light
my
christian
brethren
and
friends
he
continues
object
of
the
american
colonization
society
is
to
stay
the
effusion
of
blood
to
give
light
to
them
who
sit
in
darkness
and
to
make
reparation
for
the
wrongs
which
have
been
inflicted
upon
the
sable
sons
of
africa
as
the
people
of
color
must
evidently
be
a
distinct
and
degraded
class
while
they
reside
in
this
country
and
as
they
are
threatened
with
universal
proscription
the
society
benevolently
proposes
to
send
them
back
their
native
by
their
own
consent
together
with
those
slaves
who
may
be
emancipated
for
this
purpose
where
they
may
enjoy
equal
rights
and
privileges
nor
longer
retain
any
sense
of
inferiority
to
the
whites
every
emigrant
will
go
as
a
missionary
to
reclaim
the
poor
natives
from
their
barbarism
and
to
spread
the
tidings
of
salvation
throughout
the
african
continent
by
forming
a
chain
of
colonies
along
the
coast
a
speedy
check
will
be
given
to
the
accursed
slave
trade
a
trade
which
can
not
be
destroyed
in
any
other
manner
who
does
not
desire
to
see
africa
civilized
and
evangelized
whose
heart
does
not
leap
in
view
of
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
who
does
not
pray
for
deliverance
from
the
evils
of
slavery
who
does
not
wish
to
behold
the
free
people
of
color
cursed
with
ineffectual
freedom
here
from
their
and
placed
where
no
obstacles
will
impede
their
march
to
affluence
preferment
and
honor
the
colonization
society
then
powerfully
commends
itself
to
the
christian
the
philanthropist
and
the
patriot
to
every
section
of
our
country
and
to
all
denominations
of
men
exquisite
the
picture
is
crowded
with
attractions
delightful
to
the
eye
the
story
is
skilfully
told
and
implicitly
believed
but
like
every
other
story
it
has
two
sides
to
it
so
complete
is
the
delusion
however
that
many
good
people
are
ready
to
class
those
who
denounce
the
colonization
society
among
the
opposers
of
foreign
missions
bible
and
tract
societies
and
the
other
benevolent
operations
of
the
age
far
be
it
from
me
to
accuse
the
agents
of
the
society
of
intentionally
perverting
the
truth
or
deliberately
imposing
upon
the
credulity
of
the
public
some
perhaps
all
of
them
are
men
of
sincerity
and
probity
but
deluded
themselves
they
help
to
delude
others
their
vision
is
imperfect
and
the
blind
lead
the
blind
we
may
expect
to
find
them
in
the
same
ditch
together
great
complacency
has
been
manifested
on
various
occasions
by
the
advocates
of
the
society
on
the
ground
that
it
was
at
first
suspected
of
sinister
designs
both
at
the
north
and
the
south
but
is
now
receiving
the
countenance
of
both
this
exultation
is
premature
the
opposition
formerly
manifested
to
the
society
by
the
holders
of
slaves
grew
out
of
their
ignorance
of
its
purpose
but
a
very
large
majority
of
them
now
perceive
that
it
is
their
devoted
servant
crouching
down
at
their
feet
shielding
them
from
reproach
dragging
those
away
whom
they
dread
allowing
them
to
sin
with
impunity
and
generously
granting
them
and
their
children
whole
centuries
in
which
to
repent
and
to
surrender
what
they
have
stolen
it
dissuades
them
from
emancipating
their
slaves
faster
than
they
can
be
transported
to
africa
and
thus
regards
their
persistance
in
robbery
and
oppression
as
evidence
of
wisdom
benevolence
and
sanity
it
is
natural
that
discovering
their
mistake
they
should
now
rally
in
a
body
around
the
society
and
consequently
we
find
that
the
legislatures
of
the
several
slaveholding
states
are
passing
encomiums
upon
it
and
in
some
instances
appropriating
sums
of
money
to
be
paid
over
to
it
by
instalments
the
people
of
the
north
have
been
shamefully
duped
by
this
scheme
but
like
the
slaveholders
they
begin
to
discover
their
error
unlike
them
however
they
are
withdrawing
their
support
in
obedience
to
the
injunction
of
the
apostle
ye
not
unequally
yoked
together
with
unbelievers
for
what
fellowship
hath
righteousness
with
unrighteousness
and
what
communion
hath
light
with
darkness
and
what
concord
hath
christ
with
belial
wherefore
come
out
from
among
them
and
be
ye
separate
saith
the
lord
and
touch
not
the
unclean
thing
and
i
will
receive
you
to
africa
this
country
owes
a
debt
larger
than
she
is
able
to
liquidate
most
intensely
do
i
desire
to
see
that
continent
transformed
into
the
abode
of
civilization
of
the
arts
and
sciences
of
evangelical
piety
of
liberty
and
of
all
that
adds
to
the
dignity
the
renown
and
the
temporal
and
eternal
happiness
of
man
shame
and
confusion
of
face
belong
to
the
church
that
she
has
so
long
disregarded
the
claims
of
africa
upon
her
sympathies
and
prayers
and
liberality
claims
as
much
superior
as
its
wrongs
to
those
of
any
other
portion
of
the
globe
it
is
indeed
most
strange
that
like
the
priest
and
the
levite
she
should
have
by
on
the
other
side
and
left
the
victim
of
thieves
to
bleed
and
sicken
and
die
as
the
africans
were
the
only
people
doomed
to
perpetual
servitude
and
to
be
the
prey
of
kidnappers
she
should
have
long
since
directed
almost
her
undivided
efforts
to
civilize
and
convert
them
not
by
establishing
colonies
of
ignorant
and
selfish
foreigners
among
them
who
will
seize
every
opportunity
to
overreach
or
oppress
as
interest
or
ambition
shall
instigate
but
by
sending
intelligent
pious
missionaries
men
fearing
god
and
eschewing
evil
living
evidences
of
the
excellence
of
christianity
having
but
one
object
not
the
possession
of
wealth
or
the
obtainment
of
power
or
the
gratification
of
selfishness
but
salvation
of
the
had
she
made
this
attempt
as
she
was
bound
to
have
made
it
by
every
principle
of
justice
and
every
feeling
of
humanity
a
century
ago
africa
would
have
been
at
the
present
day
regenerated
and
disenthralled
and
the
slavery
of
her
children
brought
to
an
end
no
pirates
would
now
haunt
her
coast
to
desolate
her
villages
with
fire
and
sword
in
order
to
supply
a
christian
people
with
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
how
much
has
been
needlessly
lost
to
the
world
by
this
criminal
neglect
the
conception
of
evangelizing
a
heathenish
country
by
sending
to
it
an
illiterate
degraded
and
irreligious
population
belongs
exclusively
to
the
advocates
of
african
colonization
for
absurdity
and
inaptitude
it
stands
and
must
forever
stand
without
a
parallel
of
all
the
offspring
of
prejudice
and
oppression
it
is
the
most
shapeless
and
unnatural
but
more
of
this
hereafter
history
is
full
of
instruction
on
the
subject
of
colonization
the
establishment
of
colonies
in
all
ages
with
scarcely
an
exception
has
resulted
either
in
their
subversion
by
the
vices
or
physical
strength
of
the
natives
or
by
a
fatal
amalgamation
with
them
or
else
in
the
rapid
destruction
of
the
natives
by
the
superior
knowledge
and
greedy
avarice
of
the
new
settlers
it
is
presumption
to
suppose
that
the
colony
at
liberia
composed
of
the
worst
materials
imaginable
will
present
an
example
of
forbearance
stability
and
good
faith
hitherto
unwitnessed
in
the
world
soon
after
its
establishment
the
colony
narrowly
escaped
a
bloody
extirpation
and
was
the
cause
of
a
murderous
warfare
in
which
several
of
the
colonists
and
a
large
number
of
the
natives
were
slain
the
steady
growth
of
the
colony
excited
the
jealousy
and
alarm
of
some
of
the
neighboring
tribes
and
accordingly
a
consultation
was
held
at
which
king
george
governor
and
all
the
other
head
men
contended
that
americans
were
strangers
had
forgot
their
attachment
to
the
land
of
their
for
if
not
why
had
they
not
renounced
their
connexion
with
white
men
altogether
and
placed
themselves
under
the
protection
of
the
kings
of
the
country
king
george
had
already
been
under
the
necessity
of
removing
from
his
town
and
leaving
the
cape
in
their
hands
this
was
but
the
first
step
of
their
encroachments
if
left
alone
they
must
in
a
very
few
years
master
the
whole
country
and
as
all
other
places
were
full
their
own
tribe
must
be
without
a
home
and
cease
any
longer
to
remain
a
nation
e
this
appeal
which
evinces
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
human
nature
and
much
foresight
induced
the
attack
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
a
single
paragraph
from
the
rev
mr
ashmun
account
of
the
battle
with
the
natives
may
suffice
to
give
the
reader
an
idea
of
its
destructiveness
few
musketeers
with
johnson
at
their
head
by
passing
round
upon
the
enemy
flank
served
to
increase
the
consternation
which
was
beginning
to
pervade
their
unwieldy
body
in
about
twenty
minutes
after
the
settlers
had
taken
their
stand
the
front
of
the
enemy
began
to
recoil
but
from
the
numerous
obstructions
in
their
rear
the
entire
absence
of
discipline
and
the
extreme
difficulty
of
giving
a
reversed
motion
to
so
large
a
body
a
small
part
only
of
which
was
directly
exposed
to
danger
and
the
delay
occasioned
by
the
practice
of
carrying
off
all
their
dead
and
wounded
rendered
a
retreat
for
some
minutes
longer
impossible
the
very
violence
employed
by
those
in
the
front
in
their
impatience
to
hasten
it
by
increasing
the
confusion
produced
an
effect
opposite
to
that
intended
the
americans
perceiving
their
advantage
now
regained
possession
of
the
western
post
and
instantly
brought
the
long
nine
to
rake
the
whole
line
of
the
enemy
imagination
can
scarcely
figure
to
itself
a
throng
of
human
beings
in
a
more
capital
state
of
exposure
to
the
destructive
power
of
the
machinery
of
modern
warfare
eight
hundred
men
were
here
pressed
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
so
compact
a
form
that
a
child
might
easily
walk
upon
their
heads
from
one
end
of
the
mass
to
the
other
presenting
in
their
rear
a
breadth
of
rank
equal
to
twenty
or
thirty
men
and
all
exposed
to
a
gun
of
great
power
raised
on
a
platform
at
only
thirty
to
sixty
yards
distance
shot
literally
spent
its
force
in
a
solid
mass
of
living
human
flesh
their
fire
suddenly
terminated
a
savage
yell
was
raised
which
filled
the
dismal
forest
with
a
momentary
horror
it
gradually
died
away
and
the
whole
host
disappeared
at
the
well
known
signal
of
their
dispersion
and
return
to
their
homes
was
sounded
and
many
small
parties
seen
at
a
distance
directly
afterwards
moving
off
in
different
directions
one
large
canoe
employed
in
reconveying
a
party
across
the
mouth
of
the
montserado
venturing
within
the
range
of
the
long
gun
was
struck
by
a
shot
and
several
men
killed
f
the
above
which
can
not
be
perused
without
a
thrill
of
horror
is
one
of
the
legitimate
fruits
of
foreign
colonization
subsequent
to
this
bloody
affair
another
battle
took
place
which
resulted
in
the
defeat
of
the
natives
and
the
loss
of
many
lives
it
is
true
the
colony
since
that
period
has
received
little
molestation
and
has
succeeded
moreover
in
making
some
amicable
treaties
with
the
natives
but
in
proportion
to
its
means
of
defence
and
numerical
force
will
be
its
liability
to
encroach
upon
the
rights
of
the
africans
and
thus
to
provoke
hostilities
if
this
prophecy
should
not
be
fulfilled
history
will
have
spoken
in
vain
and
human
nature
experienced
a
total
regeneration
no
man
of
refined
sensibility
can
contemplate
the
fate
of
the
aborigines
of
this
country
without
shuddering
at
the
consequences
of
colonization
and
if
melted
away
at
the
presence
of
the
pilgrims
and
their
descendants
like
frost
before
the
meridian
blaze
of
the
sun
if
fell
to
the
earth
like
the
leaves
of
the
forest
before
the
autumnal
blast
by
the
settlement
of
men
reputedly
humane
wise
and
pious
in
their
vicinage
what
can
be
our
hope
for
the
preservation
of
the
africans
associated
with
a
population
degraded
by
slavery
and
to
a
lamentable
extent
destitute
of
religious
and
secular
knowledge
the
argument
that
the
difference
of
complexion
between
our
forefathers
and
the
aborigines
which
is
not
a
distinctive
feature
between
the
settlers
at
liberia
and
the
natives
was
the
real
cause
of
this
deadly
enmity
is
more
specious
than
solid
not
secures
friendship
or
excites
antipathy
as
it
happens
to
be
just
or
unjust
the
venerated
william
penn
and
his
pacific
followers
furnish
a
case
in
point
i
avow
it
the
natural
tendency
of
the
colony
at
liberia
excites
the
most
melancholy
apprehensions
in
my
mind
its
birth
was
conceived
in
blood
and
its
footsteps
will
be
marked
with
blood
down
to
old
age
the
blood
of
the
poor
natives
unless
a
special
interposition
of
divine
providence
prevent
such
a
calamity
the
emigrants
will
be
eager
in
the
acquisition
of
wealth
ease
and
power
and
having
superior
skill
and
discernment
in
trade
they
will
outwit
and
defraud
the
natives
as
often
as
occasion
permits
this
knavish
treatment
once
detected
as
it
surely
will
be
for
even
an
uncivilized
people
may
soon
learn
that
they
have
been
cheated
will
provoke
retaliation
and
stir
up
the
worst
passions
of
the
human
breast
bloody
conflicts
will
ensue
in
which
the
colonists
will
be
victorious
this
success
will
serve
to
increase
the
enmity
of
the
natives
and
to
perpetuate
the
murderous
struggle
the
extirpation
of
one
generation
may
put
the
colonists
in
undisputed
possession
of
the
land
this
is
not
a
fancy
sketch
it
is
not
improbable
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
obvious
and
hitherto
certain
consequence
of
bringing
hastily
together
large
bodies
of
civilized
men
with
unlettered
barbarians
jealousy
will
be
another
fruitful
source
of
contention
the
population
of
africa
is
divided
into
a
vast
number
of
tribes
governed
by
petty
kings
sometimes
indeed
united
by
an
amicable
league
but
commonly
distinct
and
independent
some
of
these
tribes
will
form
alliances
with
the
colonists
either
to
obtain
protection
from
their
more
formidable
rivals
or
from
motives
of
fear
curiosity
or
selfishness
in
this
manner
tribe
will
be
arrayed
against
tribe
throughout
that
vast
continent
the
tide
of
commotion
gathering
fresh
impetuosity
in
its
headlong
career
will
rush
from
the
mountains
down
to
the
ocean
devastating
all
that
is
beautiful
and
swiftly
defacing
that
which
will
require
the
labors
of
centuries
to
restore
to
its
pristine
excellence
there
will
be
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
succeeded
by
deceitful
and
unstable
treaties
ratified
only
to
be
broken
at
a
favorable
moment
and
these
collisions
will
not
cease
until
the
colonists
obtain
an
undisputed
mastery
over
the
natives
would
to
heaven
these
fears
might
prove
to
be
but
the
offspring
of
a
distracted
mind
may
the
colonists
be
so
just
in
their
intercourse
with
the
africans
as
never
to
impeach
their
own
integrity
so
pacific
as
to
disarm
retaliation
and
perpetuate
good
will
so
benevolent
as
to
excite
gratitude
and
diffuse
joy
wherever
their
names
shall
be
known
and
so
holy
as
to
exalt
the
christian
religion
in
the
eyes
of
an
idolatrous
nation
but
he
must
be
grossly
ignorant
of
human
nature
or
strangely
infatuated
who
believes
that
they
will
always
or
commonly
exhibit
this
unexceptionable
conduct
it
is
my
sober
conviction
that
no
contrivance
or
enterprise
could
possibly
be
planned
more
fatally
calculated
to
obstruct
the
progress
of
christianity
in
a
heathenish
country
than
the
establishment
of
a
colony
or
colonies
of
selfish
ignorant
or
even
intelligent
and
men
on
its
shores
in
every
settlement
of
this
kind
no
matter
how
choice
the
original
materials
vice
will
soon
preponderate
over
virtue
intemperance
over
sobriety
knavery
over
honesty
oppression
over
liberty
and
impiety
over
godliness
the
natives
will
see
just
enough
of
christianity
to
hate
and
shun
it
finding
that
its
fruits
are
generally
bad
that
it
has
no
restraining
influence
upon
the
mass
of
its
nominal
professors
they
will
not
easily
comprehend
the
utility
of
abandoning
their
own
idolatrous
worship
looking
only
to
the
pernicious
examples
of
the
intruders
they
will
spurn
with
contempt
the
precepts
of
the
gospel
their
confidence
will
be
abused
their
lands
craftily
trafficked
for
nought
their
ignorance
cheated
their
inferiority
treated
oppressively
and
then
what
must
naturally
follow
why
war
war
of
all
the
vices
and
few
of
the
virtues
of
the
instructers
will
be
faithfully
copied
and
thus
barriers
will
be
erected
against
the
progress
of
the
christian
religion
not
absolutely
insurmountable
it
is
true
but
sufficiently
tall
and
strong
to
retard
its
noble
career
barriers
not
only
of
superstition
and
ignorance
but
of
hatred
and
revenge
these
reflections
might
be
extended
to
the
size
of
a
volume
but
they
are
probably
sufficient
to
convince
every
unprejudiced
discerning
mind
that
the
establishment
of
foreign
colonies
in
a
barbarous
land
is
the
surest
way
to
prevent
its
speedy
evangelism
and
civilization
in
reply
to
this
reasoning
some
of
the
advocates
of
african
colonization
may
argue
that
schools
and
houses
of
worship
multiplying
with
the
growth
of
the
settlement
at
liberia
will
check
the
evil
propensities
and
passions
of
the
emigrants
and
qualify
them
to
act
as
missionaries
or
instructers
among
the
natives
and
thus
great
good
will
be
bestowed
upon
africa
this
is
at
least
a
summary
if
not
a
sure
mode
of
obviating
these
difficulties
in
the
first
place
it
is
by
no
means
certain
nay
it
is
not
probable
especially
if
the
number
of
emigrants
annually
exported
to
liberia
swell
from
hundreds
to
thousands
and
this
increase
of
transportation
is
positively
promised
by
the
parent
society
and
absolutely
necessary
to
cause
a
perceptible
diminution
in
the
annual
enlargement
of
our
colored
population
i
say
it
is
neither
certain
nor
probable
that
the
multiplication
of
literary
and
religious
privileges
will
keep
pace
with
the
unnatural
and
enormous
growth
of
the
colony
nine
years
after
the
first
settlement
of
liberia
it
appears
by
the
following
extract
of
a
letter
from
a
highly
respectable
colored
emigrant
the
rev
george
erskine
there
was
but
the
of
a
school
left
this
letter
is
dated
liberia
april
the
state
of
things
with
regard
to
schools
is
truly
lamentable
only
school
in
the
colony
at
this
time
is
a
remnant
of
one
at
the
among
the
present
emigrants
there
are
seventeen
out
of
that
can
read
the
holy
scriptures
that
now
sir
suppose
each
company
of
emigrants
to
this
place
bring
a
like
proportion
of
illiterate
persons
into
the
colony
then
what
state
think
you
it
must
be
in
but
again
sir
i
am
greatly
mistaken
if
this
colony
is
not
for
several
years
yet
to
come
mostly
to
be
peopled
with
slaves
sent
out
by
their
present
owners
without
any
education
themselves
and
without
means
and
very
little
desire
to
have
their
children
instructed
and
add
to
the
above
that
this
people
is
planted
in
the
midst
and
are
daily
conversant
with
a
people
that
are
not
only
heathen
but
a
people
extremely
partial
in
favor
of
their
grovelling
superstition
my
dear
sir
this
being
the
case
is
it
probable
that
they
will
come
over
to
us
or
we
go
down
to
to
me
the
latter
is
the
most
likely
it
is
the
very
essence
of
human
nature
to
seek
the
lowest
depth
of
permit
me
to
say
sir
there
must
be
a
great
revolution
in
this
colony
before
it
can
have
a
salutary
influence
on
the
surrounding
natives
that
is
before
it
can
have
a
moral
influence
over
them
g
subsequent
accounts
i
am
happy
to
state
present
a
better
aspect
in
relation
to
the
education
of
this
outcast
and
persecuted
people
their
wants
however
are
only
partially
supplied
the
annual
increase
of
the
free
colored
and
slave
population
in
the
united
states
is
variously
estimated
from
sixty
to
thousand
the
american
colonization
society
proposes
the
annual
removal
of
this
vast
body
and
more
if
it
be
possible
provided
the
energies
and
patronage
of
the
general
government
be
enlisted
in
this
expulsive
crusade
now
suppose
the
entire
transportation
effected
let
any
candid
man
decide
how
extremely
difficult
not
to
say
impracticable
it
would
be
to
discipline
and
instruct
such
an
overwhelming
mass
of
ignorance
or
any
considerable
portion
of
it
and
how
pernicious
must
be
the
consequences
to
the
colony
and
the
natives
if
it
should
not
receive
immediate
culture
secondly
it
is
neither
certain
nor
probable
that
allowing
all
that
is
assumed
by
colonizationists
the
influence
of
secular
and
religious
instruction
would
be
sufficient
to
restrain
the
selfish
desires
and
knavish
propensities
of
those
whose
main
object
is
not
to
evangelize
the
natives
but
to
secure
by
a
summary
process
competence
and
power
for
themselves
indeed
their
juxtaposition
with
the
natives
would
be
eminently
calculated
to
induce
the
fever
of
avarice
and
to
generate
the
lust
of
dominion
it
is
well
known
that
so
eager
are
the
colonists
to
acquire
a
rapid
accumulation
of
wealth
by
trafficking
their
paltry
beads
and
poisonous
rum
and
tobacco
for
ivory
camwood
and
gold
dust
it
is
with
the
utmost
difficulty
any
considerable
portion
of
them
are
persuaded
to
cultivate
the
soil
and
engage
in
agricultural
pursuits
thus
we
are
presented
with
the
disgraceful
if
not
singular
spectacle
of
a
rivalry
in
cunning
and
trickishness
between
a
colony
of
missionaries
really
avaricious
and
unscrupulous
foreigners
and
the
tribes
who
are
to
come
under
their
pious
pupilage
if
equal
dexterity
in
trade
is
not
apparent
each
party
is
equally
pleased
with
its
successful
attempts
at
deception
and
both
renew
the
fraudulent
commerce
with
fresh
alacrity
the
one
to
gain
a
new
triumph
and
the
other
to
retrieve
an
old
defeat
and
this
is
the
mode
of
colonizationists
to
evangelize
africa
and
this
their
mode
to
suppress
the
slave
trade
and
this
their
mode
to
elevate
the
free
people
of
color
and
this
their
mode
to
emancipate
the
slaves
it
combines
the
folly
and
absurdity
of
a
farce
with
the
solemnity
and
murderment
of
a
tragedy
far
be
it
from
me
to
leave
the
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
reader
from
these
representations
that
all
the
colonists
are
actuated
by
the
same
selfish
motives
or
that
they
have
exhibited
any
new
and
extraordinary
traits
of
character
in
their
commerce
with
the
africans
many
of
them
i
believe
are
men
who
fear
god
and
desire
the
welfare
of
his
creatures
all
of
them
have
behaved
as
honorably
perhaps
and
trafficked
as
equitably
as
any
other
body
of
men
white
or
yellow
would
have
done
in
the
same
situation
and
under
the
same
circumstances
dishonesty
in
trade
is
no
prodigy
even
in
this
country
to
bring
accusations
of
fraud
cupidity
and
cunning
against
human
nature
is
not
libellous
i
am
persuaded
that
robbery
well
contrived
deliberately
executed
robbery
is
perpetrated
in
every
community
among
ourselves
without
any
due
estimate
of
its
moral
turpitude
by
reputable
merchants
and
traders
upon
their
customers
to
a
larger
extent
than
all
the
avowed
and
heinous
thefts
collectively
which
are
committed
against
society
it
is
lamentable
to
see
how
studiously
conscience
and
fair
dealing
are
excluded
from
the
secular
business
of
the
world
if
we
see
every
day
illustrations
of
this
dishonest
conduct
given
by
men
of
refinement
intelligence
and
good
character
what
should
we
expect
from
those
whose
fetters
have
hardly
fallen
from
their
limbs
who
have
been
systematically
degraded
by
slavery
who
have
not
consequently
that
lively
sense
of
moral
obligation
which
accompanies
intelligence
who
are
beyond
the
influence
of
public
sentiment
and
surrounded
by
a
barbarous
people
the
establishment
of
a
colony
of
speculators
then
to
evangelize
africa
does
not
discover
much
wisdom
or
promise
much
success
but
on
the
contrary
exhibits
a
total
blindness
of
vision
and
a
most
unfavorable
aspect
let
it
be
remembered
however
that
and
two
poisons
which
are
exactly
adapted
to
destroy
both
soul
and
body
are
the
principal
articles
given
to
the
natives
because
pertinaciously
demanded
by
them
in
exchange
for
their
own
their
appetite
for
spirituous
liquor
first
created
by
the
slave
traders
and
subsequently
excited
by
the
colonists
is
insatiate
even
the
justly
lamented
ashmun
if
i
do
not
mistake
for
i
have
not
his
letter
now
before
me
was
so
imprudent
in
one
of
his
epistles
to
the
board
of
managers
as
to
concede
the
fatal
necessity
of
selling
rum
freely
to
the
natives
in
order
to
maintain
a
commercial
intercourse
with
them
rum
they
would
have
or
nothing
and
rum
they
obtained
then
and
do
now
obtain
any
one
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
read
the
advertisements
in
the
liberia
herald
will
discover
that
ardent
spirits
form
a
prominent
item
in
the
list
of
articles
offered
for
sale
of
the
sobriety
of
the
colonists
however
common
report
speaks
in
the
most
gratifying
manner
but
as
their
number
is
to
be
increased
by
a
redundant
importation
we
have
reason
to
fear
a
declension
of
morals
thirdly
colonizationists
strenuously
contend
that
our
colored
population
are
destined
always
to
remain
a
degraded
class
in
this
country
if
educated
any
where
they
must
be
educated
in
africa
we
must
take
them
in
their
ignorance
and
just
released
from
bondage
and
translate
them
to
another
continent
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
delay
would
be
injurious
to
ourselves
and
calamitous
to
them
they
must
go
in
large
bodies
by
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
annually
till
the
whole
be
expelled
from
our
shores
for
it
seems
according
to
the
logic
of
colonizationists
every
individual
tainted
with
black
blood
must
be
transported
to
insure
the
regeneration
of
africa
neither
fifty
thousand
nor
one
hundred
thousand
nor
half
a
million
of
these
will
be
able
to
accomplish
the
task
but
two
millions
of
slaves
and
four
hundred
thousand
free
people
of
color
and
all
their
descendants
in
time
to
come
here
even
little
babes
pretty
prattling
reformers
and
children
the
maimed
the
halt
and
the
blind
all
must
be
sent
off
else
alas
alas
for
poor
benighted
africa
this
is
no
caricature
an
ugly
face
is
sure
to
quarrel
with
its
own
likeness
but
what
is
the
portrait
worth
if
it
bear
no
resemblance
to
the
living
original
they
who
place
themselves
in
a
ridiculous
attitude
must
not
claim
exemption
from
ridicule
let
us
turn
to
the
picture
once
more
it
is
worth
our
while
to
contemplate
it
a
few
moments
longer
what
do
we
see
more
than
portion
of
the
american
people
confessedly
the
most
vicious
degraded
and
dangerous
portion
crowded
on
the
shores
of
africa
by
means
which
are
hereafter
to
be
considered
and
at
an
expense
which
we
shall
not
stop
now
to
calculate
for
the
purpose
of
civilizing
and
evangelizing
africa
and
of
improving
their
own
condition
here
then
are
ignorant
and
depraved
nations
to
be
regenerated
instead
of
if
we
may
call
all
the
natives
that
occupy
that
vast
continent
a
nation
two
huge
and
heterogeneous
masses
of
contagion
mingled
together
for
the
preservation
of
each
one
of
these
nations
is
so
incorrigibly
stupid
or
unfathomably
deep
in
pollution
for
such
is
the
argument
that
although
surrounded
by
ten
millions
of
people
living
under
the
full
blaze
of
gospel
light
and
having
every
desirable
facility
to
elevate
and
save
it
it
never
can
rise
until
it
be
removed
at
least
three
thousand
miles
from
their
vicinage
and
yet
it
is
first
to
be
evangelized
in
a
barbarous
land
by
a
feeble
inadequate
process
before
it
can
be
qualified
to
evangelize
the
other
nation
in
other
words
men
who
are
intellectually
and
morally
blind
are
violently
removed
from
light
effulgent
into
thick
darkness
in
order
that
they
may
obtain
light
themselves
and
diffuse
light
among
others
ignorance
is
sent
to
instruct
ignorance
ungodliness
to
exhort
ungodliness
vice
to
stop
the
progress
of
vice
and
depravity
to
reform
depravity
all
that
is
abhorrent
to
our
moral
sense
or
dangerous
to
our
quietude
or
villanous
in
human
nature
we
benevolently
disgorge
upon
africa
for
her
temporal
and
eternal
welfare
we
propose
to
build
upon
her
shores
for
her
glory
and
defence
colonies
framed
of
materials
which
we
discard
as
worthless
for
our
own
use
and
which
possess
no
fitness
or
durability
admirable
consistency
surprising
wisdom
unexampled
benevolence
as
rationally
might
we
think
of
exhausting
the
ocean
by
multiplying
the
number
of
its
tributaries
or
extinguishing
a
fire
by
piling
fuel
upon
it
lastly
any
scheme
to
proselytize
which
requires
for
its
protection
the
erection
of
forts
and
the
use
of
murderous
weapons
is
opposed
to
the
genius
of
christianity
and
radically
wrong
if
the
gospel
can
not
be
propagated
but
by
the
aid
of
the
sword
if
its
success
depend
upon
the
muscular
power
and
military
science
of
its
apostles
it
were
better
to
leave
the
pagan
world
in
darkness
the
first
specimen
of
and
which
the
colonists
gave
to
the
natives
was
the
building
of
a
fort
and
supplying
it
with
arms
and
ammunition
this
was
an
earnest
manifestation
of
that
on
earth
good
will
to
man
which
these
expatriated
were
sent
to
inculcate
how
eminently
calculated
to
inspire
the
confidence
excite
the
gratitude
and
accelerate
the
conversion
of
the
africans
their
of
the
great
guns
of
the
islanders
to
adopt
the
language
of
mr
ashmun
must
from
the
beginning
have
made
a
deep
and
salutary
impression
upon
their
minds
and
when
not
long
afterward
shot
from
these
guns
its
force
in
a
solid
mass
of
living
human
their
own
flesh
they
must
have
experienced
a
total
regeneration
bullets
and
cannon
balls
argue
with
resistless
effect
and
as
easily
convert
a
barbarous
as
civilized
people
one
sanguinary
conflict
was
sufficient
to
spread
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
among
a
thousand
tribes
almost
with
the
rapidity
of
light
but
even
irony
though
appropriate
is
painful
i
forbear
but
says
an
objector
these
reflections
come
too
late
the
colony
is
planted
whatever
may
be
its
influence
what
do
you
recommend
its
immediate
abandonment
to
want
and
ruin
shall
we
not
bestow
upon
it
our
charities
and
commend
it
to
the
protection
of
heaven
i
answer
let
the
colony
continue
to
receive
the
aid
and
elicit
the
prayers
of
the
good
and
benevolent
still
let
it
remain
within
the
pale
of
christian
sympathy
blot
it
not
out
of
existence
but
let
it
henceforth
develope
itself
naturally
crowd
not
its
population
let
transportation
cease
seek
no
longer
to
exile
millions
of
our
colored
countrymen
for
assuredly
if
the
colonization
society
succeed
in
its
efforts
to
remove
thousands
of
their
number
annually
it
could
not
inflict
a
heavier
curse
upon
africa
or
more
speedily
assist
in
the
entire
subversion
of
the
colony
but
the
objector
asks
how
shall
we
evangelize
africa
in
the
same
manner
as
we
have
evangelized
the
sandwich
and
society
islands
and
portions
of
burmah
hindostan
and
other
lands
by
sending
missionaries
of
the
cross
who
shall
neither
build
forts
nor
trust
in
weapons
of
war
who
shall
be
actuated
by
a
holy
zeal
and
genuine
love
who
shall
be
qualified
to
instruct
admonish
enlighten
and
proselyte
who
shall
not
by
their
examples
impugn
the
precepts
or
subject
to
suspicion
the
inspiration
of
the
word
of
life
who
shall
not
be
covered
with
pollution
and
shame
as
with
a
garment
or
add
to
the
ignorance
sin
and
corruption
of
paganism
and
who
shall
abhor
dishonesty
violence
and
treachery
such
men
have
been
found
to
volunteer
their
services
for
the
redemption
of
a
lost
world
and
such
men
may
be
found
now
to
embark
in
the
same
glorious
enterprise
a
hundred
evangelists
like
these
dispersed
along
the
shores
and
in
the
interior
of
africa
would
destroy
more
idols
make
more
progress
in
civilizing
the
natives
suppress
more
wars
unite
in
amity
more
hostile
tribes
and
convert
more
souls
to
christ
in
ten
years
than
a
colony
of
ignorant
uncultivated
selfish
emigrants
in
a
century
such
a
mission
would
be
consonant
with
reason
and
common
sense
nor
could
it
fail
to
receive
the
approbation
of
god
how
simple
was
the
command
of
our
blessed
saviour
to
his
disciples
ye
forth
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
not
out
from
among
yourselves
those
whom
you
despise
or
against
whom
you
cherish
a
strong
antipathy
those
who
need
to
be
instructed
and
converted
themselves
those
who
are
the
dregs
of
society
made
vicious
and
helpless
by
oppression
and
public
opinion
those
who
are
beyond
the
reach
of
the
gospel
in
a
christian
land
those
whose
complexions
are
not
precisely
like
yours
or
who
have
any
personal
blemishes
whatever
that
excite
your
dislike
send
out
these
to
evangelize
the
nations
which
sit
in
darkness
and
in
the
regions
of
the
shadow
of
death
denham
clapperton
and
lander
travellers
in
africa
represent
the
natives
in
a
light
most
favorable
for
the
introduction
of
christianity
as
eager
to
learn
and
become
a
civilized
and
great
people
like
the
europeans
excepting
the
followers
of
mohammed
they
are
not
tenacious
of
their
forms
of
religious
worship
and
a
considerable
portion
of
them
are
totally
indifferent
to
devotional
exercises
it
seems
apparent
that
the
fruits
of
a
mission
in
africa
would
be
thrice
as
numerous
as
those
of
one
in
india
because
the
obstacles
to
be
surmounted
are
far
less
formidable
but
says
the
objector
the
climate
of
africa
is
fatal
to
white
men
so
is
the
climate
of
india
but
our
missionaries
have
not
counted
their
lives
dear
unto
themselves
and
as
fast
as
one
is
cut
down
another
stands
ready
to
supply
his
place
i
do
not
believe
that
the
creator
has
immoveably
fixed
the
habitations
of
any
people
within
a
boundary
narrower
than
the
circumference
of
the
globe
i
believe
that
rapid
transitions
from
intensity
of
heat
and
cold
and
cold
and
heat
are
destructive
to
animal
life
but
i
also
believe
that
the
human
body
is
easily
acclimated
in
any
region
of
the
world
i
believe
the
time
is
swiftly
approaching
when
empires
and
continents
shall
as
freely
commingle
their
population
as
do
states
and
neighborhoods
to
limit
or
obstruct
this
intercourse
is
to
impoverish
and
circumscribe
human
happiness
civilization
will
remove
those
causes
which
now
engender
pestilence
and
death
and
neutralize
the
effects
of
atmospherical
contagion
hence
it
will
be
seen
that
i
do
not
assail
the
colonization
society
as
many
others
have
done
simply
because
the
settlement
at
liberia
is
unhealthy
it
is
true
the
mortality
among
the
emigrants
has
been
excessive
and
so
it
was
among
the
first
settlers
of
but
the
climate
of
is
no
longer
pestiferous
and
the
climate
of
africa
will
grow
sweet
and
salubrious
as
her
forests
disappear
and
the
purifying
influences
of
christianity
penetrate
into
the
interior
i
expressly
contend
however
that
it
is
murderous
indiscriminately
to
colonize
large
bodies
of
men
women
and
children
in
a
foreign
land
before
the
natives
are
to
some
extent
elevated
by
missionary
effort
and
therefore
i
consider
the
colonization
society
as
responsible
for
the
lives
of
those
who
have
perished
prematurely
at
liberia
but
the
objection
is
fallacious
if
white
missionaries
can
not
black
ones
can
survive
in
africa
what
then
is
our
duty
obviously
to
educate
colored
young
men
of
genius
enterprise
and
piety
expressly
to
carry
the
tidings
of
great
joy
to
her
shores
enough
i
venture
to
affirm
stand
ready
to
be
sent
if
they
can
first
be
qualified
for
their
mission
if
our
free
colored
population
were
brought
into
our
schools
and
raised
from
their
present
low
estate
i
am
confident
that
an
army
of
christian
volunteers
would
go
out
from
their
ranks
by
a
divine
impulse
and
under
the
guidance
of
the
holy
spirit
to
redeem
their
african
brethren
from
the
bondage
of
idolatry
and
the
dominion
of
spiritual
death
whatever
may
be
the
result
of
this
great
controversy
i
shall
have
the
consolation
of
believing
that
no
efforts
were
lacking
on
my
part
to
uproot
the
prejudices
of
my
countrymen
to
persuade
them
to
walk
in
the
path
of
duty
and
shun
the
precipice
of
expediency
to
unloose
the
heavy
burdens
and
let
the
prisoners
go
free
at
once
to
warn
them
of
the
danger
of
expelling
the
people
of
color
from
their
native
land
and
to
convince
them
of
the
necessity
of
abandoning
a
dangerous
and
chimerical
as
well
as
unchristian
and
association
for
these
efforts
i
have
hitherto
suffered
reproach
and
persecution
and
must
expect
to
suffer
till
i
perish
this
book
will
doubtless
increase
the
rage
of
my
enemies
but
no
torrent
of
invective
shall
successfully
whelm
it
no
sophistry
impair
its
force
no
activity
destroy
its
influence
no
misrepresentation
defeat
its
usefulness
i
commend
it
particularly
to
the
candid
attention
of
the
two
most
powerful
classes
in
this
country
editors
of
newspapers
and
the
clergy
it
is
not
a
light
matter
for
either
of
them
to
propagate
false
doctrines
and
excite
delusive
hopes
on
the
subject
of
politics
or
religion
although
the
press
is
committed
to
a
wide
extent
i
place
too
much
reliance
upon
the
good
sense
and
liberal
patriotism
of
its
conductors
to
believe
that
the
evidence
which
is
presented
in
these
pages
of
the
inefficiency
and
injustice
of
the
colonization
scheme
will
fail
to
convince
their
understanding
i
cherish
still
higher
expectations
of
its
salutary
influence
upon
ministers
of
the
gospel
it
may
grieve
them
to
discover
that
they
have
been
misled
themselves
and
that
they
have
unwittingly
misled
others
to
say
to
their
flocks
have
erred
in
this
matter
we
have
solicited
your
charities
for
an
institution
which
is
built
upon
prejudice
and
persecution
we
have
hastily
adopted
the
mistaken
opinions
of
others
such
a
confession
may
indeed
require
much
grace
in
the
heart
but
this
grace
i
am
persuaded
they
will
obtain
as
apostles
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
sustaining
high
and
awful
responsibilities
and
exerting
an
influence
which
measurably
decides
the
eternal
destiny
of
the
souls
of
men
they
will
not
shut
their
eyes
or
stop
their
ears
or
refuse
to
examine
or
disregard
the
truth
in

case
involving

temporal
and
eternal
happiness
of

the
american
colonization
society
is
pledged
not
to
oppose
the
system
of
slavery
having
concluded
my
introductory
remarks
i
now
proceed
to
substantiate
my
accusations
against
the
american
colonization
society
by
marshalling
in
review
the
sentiments
of
those
who
first
originated
it
and
who
are
its
efficient
managers
and
advocates
it
is
obvious
that
with
my
limited
means
and
in
a
book
designed
for
a
cheap
circulation
i
shall
not
be
able
to
enter
into
so
minute
a
detail
as
the
present
exigency
demands
or
make
those
comments
which
might
serve
more
fully
to
illustrate
the
character
of
this
association
it
should
be
stated
moreover
that
i
have
not
made
any
particular
effort
to
procure
materials
for
this
work
being
satisfied
that
those
which
have
almost
accidentally
fallen
into
my
hands
contain
ample
and
conclusive
evidence
of
the
unworthiness
of
the
society
a
vast
number
of
the
reports
of
auxiliary
bodies
in
various
parts
of
the
country
of
orations
and
sermons
and
essays
in
favor
of
african
colonization
are
beyond
my
reach
and
must
remain
unconsulted
if
more
proof
be
demanded
it
shall
be
given
to
the
public
there
is
not
a
sound
timber
in
this
great
babel
from
the
foundation
to
the
roof
it
is
rotten
and
defective
i
shall
not
stop
to
interrogate
the
motives
of
those
who
planned
the
society
some
of
them
undoubtedly
were
actuated
by
a
benevolent
desire
to
promote
the
welfare
of
our
colored
population
and
could
never
have
intended
to
countenance
oppression
but
the
question
is
not
whether
their
motives
were
good
or
bad
suppose
they
were
all
good
would
this
fact
prove
infallibly
that
they
could
not
err
in
judgment
do
we
not
almost
daily
see
men
running
headlong
into
wild
and
injurious
enterprises
with
the
very
best
intentions
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
meaning
well
and
doing
well
the
slave
trade
originated
in
a
compassionate
regard
for
the
benighted
africans
and
yet
we
hang
those
who
are
detected
in
this
traffic
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
robert
finley
and
elias
caldwell
were
philanthropic
individuals
and
that
a
large
number
of
their
followers
are
men
of
piety
benevolence
and
moral
worth
what
then
is
the
american
colonization
society
a
beneficial
institution
we
shall
see
hereafter
the
history
of
this
society
is
familiar
to
the
public
it
was
organized
about
the
commencement
of
the
year
the
first
public
meeting
to
consider
the
expediency
of
such
an
organization
was
held
on
the
of
december
at
which
the
hon
henry
clay
presided
but
i
have
never
seen
its
official
proceedings
it
was
addressed
by
mr
clay
mr
caldwell
and
other
gentlemen
from
whose
speeches
extracts
will
shortly
be
given
it
is
my
purpose
in
this
section
to
show
first
the
original
design
of
the
society
secondly
that
it
is
still
strictly
adhered
to
and
lastly
that
the
society
is
solemnly
pledged
not
to
interfere
with
the
system
of
slavery
or
in
any
manner
to
disturb
the
repose
of
the
planters
upon
the
rigid
observance
of
this
sinful
pledge
depends
its
existence
a
single
violation
of
it
would
be
fatal
i
want
no
better
reason
than
this
to
wage
an
uncompromising
warfare
against
it
no
man
has
a
right
to
form
an
alliance
with
others
which
prevents
him
from
rebuking
sin
or
exposing
the
guilt
of
sinners
every
individual
is
bound
to
oppose
the
system
of
slavery
in
the
most
direct
strenuous
unfaltering
manner
bound
by
the
ties
of
brotherhood
by
the
spirit
of
christianity
by
the
genius
of
republicanism
by
the
dictates
of
humanity
by
the
requirements
of
justice
by
the
love
of
country
by
duty
to
his
god
he
can
not
suppress
his
voice
nor
stop
his
ears
to
the
groans
of
the
prisoners
and
be
innocent
if
he
hide
the
truth
because
it
may
give
offence
if
he
strike
hands
in
amity
with
a
thief
if
he
leave
the
needy
and
oppressed
to
perish
god
will
visit
him
with
plagues
now
the
language
of
the
members
of
the
colonization
society
to
the
owners
of
slaves
is
virtually
as
follows
free
people
of
color
are
a
nuisance
to
us
and
plotters
of
sedition
among
your
slaves
if
they
be
not
speedily
removed
your
will
be
lost
and
your
lives
destroyed
we
therefore
do
solemnly
agree
that
if
you
will
unite
with
us
in
expelling
this
dangerous
class
from
our
shores
we
will
never
accuse
you
of
robbery
or
oppression
or
irritate
your
feelings
by
asserting
the
right
of
the
slaves
to
immediate
freedom
or
identify
any
one
of
you
as
a
criminal
but
on
the
contrary
we
will
boldly
assert
your
innocence
and
applaud
you
as
wise
and
benevolent
men
for
holding
your
slaves
in
subjection
until
you
can
cast
them
out
of
the
country
i
say
this
is
their
language
as
i
shall
soon
indisputably
show
thus
we
are
presented
with
the
strange
spectacle
of
a
procession
composed
of
the
most
heterogeneous
materials
there
go
a
divine
and
a
southern
kidnapper
and
there
an
ungodly
slaveholder
and
a
pious
deacon
each
eyeing
the
other
with
distrust
and
fearful
of
exciting
a
quarrel
both
denouncing
the
poor
neglected
despised
free
black
man
as
a
miserable
creature
and
both
gravely
complimenting
their
foresight
and
generosity
in
sending
this
worthless
wretch
on
a
religious
mission
to
africa
i
can
not
exhibit
the
folly
and
wickedness
of
this
alliance
in
a
clearer
light
than
by
inserting
the
following
extract
of
a
letter
from
capt
charles
stuart
of
the
english
royal
navy
one
of
the
most
indefatigable
philanthropists
in
england
american
colonization
society
looks
abroad
over
its
own
country
and
it
finds
a
mass
of
its
brethren
whom
god
has
been
pleased
to
clothe
with
a
darker
skin
it
finds
one
portion
of
these
free
another
enslaved
it
finds
a
cruel
prejudice
as
dark
and
false
as
sin
can
make
it
reigning
with
a
most
tyrannous
sway
against
both
it
finds
this
prejudice
respecting
the
declaring
without
a
blush
we
are
too
wicked
ever
to
love
them
as
god
commands
us
to
do
we
are
so
resolute
in
our
wickedness
as
not
even
to
desire
to
do
so
and
we
are
so
proud
in
our
iniquity
that
we
will
hate
and
revile
whoever
disturbs
us
in
it
we
want
like
the
devils
of
old
to
be
let
alone
in
our
sin
we
are
unalterably
determined
and
neither
god
nor
man
shall
move
us
from
this
resolution
that
our
free
colored
fellow
subjects
never
shall
be
happy
in
their
native
land
the
american
colonization
society
i
say
finds
this
most
base
and
cruel
prejudice
lets
it
nay
more
it
directly
and
powerfully
supports
it
american
colonization
society
finds
of
its
fellow
subjects
most
iniquitously
enslaved
and
it
finds
a
resolution
as
proud
and
wicked
as
the
very
spirit
of
the
pit
can
make
it
against
god
and
go
free
in
their
native
land
lets
this
perfectly
infernal
resolution
nay
more
it
powerfully
supports
it
for
it
in
fact
says
as
a
fond
and
feeble
father
might
say
to
some
overgrown
baby
before
whose
obstinate
wickedness
he
quailed
never
mind
my
dear
i
want
to
prevent
your
beating
and
abusing
your
brothers
and
sisters
let
that
be
but
here
is
a
box
of
sugar
plums
do
pray
give
them
one
or
two
now
and
then
the
american
colonization
society
says
practically
to
the
slaveholders
and
the
slave
party
in
the
united
states
we
do
want
to
prevent
your
plundering
of
our
fellow
subjects
of
their
liberty
and
of
the
fruits
of
their
toil
although
we
know
that
by
every
principle
of
law
which
does
not
utterly
disgrace
us
by
assimilating
us
to
pirates
that
they
have
as
good
and
as
true
a
right
to
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
as
we
have
and
although
we
ourselves
stand
prepared
to
die
rather
than
submit
even
to
a
fragment
of
the
intolerable
load
of
oppression
to
which
we
are
subjecting
them
yet
never
mind
let
that
be
they
have
grown
old
in
suffering
and
we
in
iniquity
and
we
have
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
speak
to
one
another
in
our
sins
but
if
any
of
their
masters
whether
from
benevolence
an
awakened
conscience
or
political
or
personal
fear
should
emancipate
any
let
us
send
them
to
liberia
that
is
in
fact
let
us
give
a
sugar
plum
here
and
there
to
a
few
while
the
many
are
living
and
dying
unredressed
and
while
we
are
thus
countenancing
the
atrocious
iniquity
beneath
which
they
are
perishing
in
this
aspect
i
find
the
american
colonization
society
declaring
itself
a
substitute
for
emancipation
and
it
is
in
this
aspect
that
i
contend
with
it
and
that
i
proclaim
it
far
as
it
has
this
no
farther
a
bane
to
the
colored
people
whether
enslaved
or
free
and
a
snare
and
a
disgrace
to
its
country
the
second
article
of
the
constitution
of
this
society
is
in
the
following
language
object
to
which
its
attention
is
to
be
directed
is
to
promote
and
execute
a
plan
for
colonizing
with
their
consent
the
free
people
of
color
residing
in
our
country
in
africa
or
such
other
place
as
congress
shall
deem
most
expedient
and
the
society
shall
act
to
effect
this
object
in
with
the
general
government
and
such
of
the
states
as
may
adopt
regulations
upon
the
subject
the
following
citations
abundantly
sustain
the
charge
that
the
society
has
not
swerved
from
its
original
design
and
does
not
oppose
the
system
of
slavery
he
was
up
he
would
detain
the
society
for
a
few
moments
it
was
proper
again
and
again
to
repeat
that
it
was
far
from
the
intention
of
the
society
to
affect
any
the
tenure
by
which
a
certain
species
of
property
is
held
he
was
himself
a
slaveholder
he
considered
that
kind
of
property
as
inviolable
as
any
other
in
the
he
would
resist
as
soon
and
with
as
much
firmness
encroachments
upon
it
as
he
would
encroachments
upon
any
other
property
which
he
held
nor
was
he
disposed
even
to
go
as
far
as
the
gentleman
who
had
just
spoken
mr
mercer
in
saying
that
he
would
emancipate
his
slaves
if
the
means
were
provided
of
sending
them
from
the
country
speech
of
henry
first
annual
report
was
proper
and
necessary
distinctly
to
state
that
he
understood
it
constituted
no
part
of
the
object
of
this
meeting
to
touch
or
agitate
in
the
slightest
degree
a
delicate
question
connected
with
another
portion
of
the
colored
population
of
our
country
it
was
not
proposed
to
deliberate
upon
or
consider
at
all
any
question
of
emancipation
or
that
which
was
connected
with
the
abolition
of
slavery
it
was
upon
that
condition
alone
he
was
sure
that
many
gentlemen
from
the
south
and
west
whom
he
saw
present
had
attended
or
could
be
expected
to
it
was
upon
that
condition
only
that
he
himself
had
attended
speech
of
mr
clay
before
the
society
second
annual
report
had
been
properly
observed
by
the
chairman
as
well
as
by
the
gentleman
from
this
district
messrs
clay
and
caldwell
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
proposition
submitted
to
consideration
which
in
the
smallest
degree
touched
another
very
important
and
delicate
question
which
ought
to
be
left
as
much
out
of
view
as
possible
negro
slavery
mr
concluded
by
saying
that
he
had
thought
it
necessary
to
make
these
remarks
being
a
slaveholder
himself
to
shew
that
so
far
from
being
connected
with
the
abolition
of
slavery
measure
proposed
would
prove
one
of
the
greatest
securities
to
enable
the
master
to
keep
in
possession
his
own
speech
of
john
randolph
at
the
same
meeting
committee
would
not
thus
favorably
regard
the
prayer
of
the
memorialists
if
it
sought
to
impair
the
slightest
the
rights
of
private
property
or
the
yet
more
sacred
rights
of
personal
liberty
secured
to
every
description
of
freemen
in
the
united
states
resolution
of
the
legislature
of
virginia
the
subsequent
acts
and
declarations
as
well
as
the
high
character
of
the
memorialists
themselves
added
to
the
most
obvious
interest
of
the
states
who
have
recently
sanctioned
the
purpose
or
recognized
the
existence
of
the
american
colonization
society
exclude
remotest
apprehension
of
such
injustice
and

of

of

for
the
benefit
of

blacks
in
which
all
parts
of
the
country
can
unite

course
not
have

of

for
its
immediate
nor
may
it
aim
directly
at
the
instruction
of
the
blacks
in
either
case
the
and
of
the
slaveholding
states
would
be
excited
in
a
moment
and
with
reason
too
for
it
is
a
point
that
public
safety
forbids
either
the
emancipation
or
the
general
instruction
of
the
african
colonization

an
enterprise
in
which
parts
of

country
can
the
grand
objection
to
every
other
effort
is
that
it
excites
the
and
of

here
is
an
effort
in
which
the

objection
may
be
resolved
into
this
that

secretly
undermining

it

they
would
never

associated
themselves
together

they

from

to
excite
no

avoid
with
the
most
sedulous

every

managers
could
with
no
propriety
depart
from

original

make

still
consider

to

it
will
grow
more
and
more
excessive
until
it
can
no
longer
be
endured
by
god
nor
borne
with
by
man
and
this
is
the
system
with
which
as
the
reader
has
seen
the
american
colonization
society
is
resolved
not
to
interfere
and
with
the
upholders
of
which
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
professors
of
religion
of
all
denominations
have
made
a
treaty
of
peace
tell
it
not
abroad
publish
it
not
in
the
capitals
of
europe
lest
the
despots
of
the
old
world
take
courage
and
infidelity
strengthen
its
stakes
if
men
who
are
reputedly
wise
and
good
if
religious
teachers
and
political
leaders
those
whose
opinions
are
almost
implicitly
adopted
and
whose
examples
are
readily
followed
by
the
mass
of
the
people
if
such
men
suppress
their
voices
on
this
momentous
subject
and
turn
their
eyes
from
its
contemplation
and
give
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
to
the
buyers
and
sellers
of
human
flesh
is
there
not
cause
for
lamentation
and
alarm
the
pulpit
is
false
to
its
trust
and
a
moral
paralysis
has
seized
the
vitals
of
the
church
the
sanctity
of
religion
is
thrown
like
a
mantle
over
the
horrid

under

auspices

the

too
by
its
profound
silence
or
selfish
neutrality
or
equivocal
course

enlisted
in
the

of

the
mighty

has
power

exerted
aright
to
break
every

and
emancipate
the

if
this
state
of
things
be
not

reversed

all

men

the

lift
up
the
voice
of
warning
supplication
and

with
a
fidelity
which
no

can
bribe

no

organise
and

for
the
redemption
of

as

will

the

behind

take
refuge
they
profess
to
be
and
doubtless
in
many
instances
are
aiming
at
the
ultimate
emancipation
of
the
slaves
but
they
are
all
for
abolition
all
too
courteous
to
give
offence
too
sober
to
be
madmen
too
discreet
to
adopt
measures
but
i
shall
show
in
the
progress
of
this
work
that
they
not
only
shield
the
holders
of
slaves
from
reproach
and
thus
by
assuring
them
of
their
innocence
destroy
all
motives
for
repentance
but
earnestly
dissuade
them
from
emancipating
their
slaves
without
an
immediate
expulsion
fine
conceptions
of
justice
enemies
of
slavery
with
a
vengeance
suppose
a
similar
course
had
been
pursued
by
the
friends
of
temperance
when
would
have
commenced
that
mighty
reformation
which
has
taken
place
before
our
eyes
unparalleled
in
extent
completeness
and
rapidity
suppose
instead
of
exposing
the
guilt
of
trafficking
in
ardent
spirits
and
demanding
instant
and
entire
abstinence
they
had
associated
themselves
together
for
the
exclusive
purpose
of
colonizing
all
the
drunkards
in
the
land
as
a
class
dangerous
to
our
safety
and
irremediably
degraded
on
a
spot
where
they
could
not
obtain
the
poisonous
alcohol
but
could
rise
to
respect
and
affluence
how
would
such
an
enterprise
have
been
received
suppose
they
had
pledged
themselves
not
to
with
the
business
of
the
traders
in
spirituous
liquors
or
to
injure
the
of
distillers
and
had
dwelt
upon
the
folly
and
danger
of
abstinence
and
had
denounced
the
advocates
of
this
doctrine
as
madmen
and
fanatics
and
had
endeavored
moreover
to
suppress
inquiry
into
the
lawfulness
of
how
many
importers
makers
and
venders
of
the
liquid
poison
would
have
abandoned
their
occupation
or
how
many
of
the
four
hundred
thousand
individuals
who
are
now
enrolled
under
the
banner
of
entire
abstinence
would
have
been
united
in
this
great
enterprise
suppose
further
that
in
a
lapse
of
fifteen
years
this
association
had
transported
two
thousand
drunkards
and
the
tide
of
intemperance
had
continued
to
rise
higher
and
higher
and
some
faithful
watchmen
had
given
the
alarm
and
showed
the
fatal
delusion
which
rested
upon
the
land
and
the
society
should
have
defended
itself
by
pointing
to
the
two
thousand
sots
who
had
been
saved
by
its
instrumentality
would
the
public
attention
have
been
successfully
diverted
from
the
to
the
suppose
once
more
that
this
society
composed
indiscriminately
of
and
sober
pious
men
on
being
charged
with
perpetuating
the
evils
of
intemperance
with
removing
only
some
of
the
fruits
thereof
instead
of
the
tree
itself
should
have
indignantly
repelled
the
charge
and
said
are
as
much
opposed
to
drunkenness
and
as
heartily
deprecate
its
existence
as
any
of
our
violent
fanatical
opposers
but
the
holders
of
ardent
spirit
have
invested
their
capital
in
it
and
to
destroy
its
sale
would
invade
the
right
of
policy
at
least
bids
us
not
to
assail
their
conduct
as
otherwise
we
might
exasperate
them
and
so
lose
their
aid
in
colonizing
the
tipplers
what
would
have
been
accomplished
but
no
such
logic
was
used
the
duty
of
immediate
reform
was
constantly
pressed
upon
the
people
and
a
mighty
reform
took
place
colonizationists
boast
inordinately
of
having
emancipated
three
or
four
hundred
slaves
by
their
scheme
and
contemptuously
inquire
of
abolitionists
have
effected
many
persons
have
been
deceived
by
this
of
success
and
deem
it
conclusive
evidence
of
the
usefulness
of
the
colonization
society
but
in
the
first
place
it
is
very
certain
that
none
of
these
slaves
were
liberated
in
consequence
of
the
faithful
appeals
of
the
society
to
the
consciences
of
the
masters
for
it
has
never
troubled
their
consciences
by
any
such
appeals
secondly
it
is
obvious
that
these
manumissions
are
the
fruits
of
the
uncompromising
doctrines
of
abolitionists
for
they
are
calculated
to
bring
slaveholders
to
repentance
and
they
will
yet
liberate
other
slaves
to
be
caught
up
and
claimed
by
the
society
as
trophies
of
its
success
thirdly
it
has
been
shown
that
while
this
society
allowing
it
the
utmost
that
it
claims
is
effecting
very
little
and
very
doubtful
good
it
is
inflicting
upon
the
nation
great
and
positive
evil
by
refusing
to
arraign
the
oppressors
at
the
bar
of
eternal
justice
and
by
obstructing
the
formation
of
abolition
societies
it
rivets
a
thousand
fetters
where
it
breaks
one
it
annually
removes
on
an
average
two
hundred
of
our
colored
population
whereas
the
annual
increase
is
about
seventy
thousand
it
releases
some
scores
of
slaves
and
says
to
the
owners
of
more
than
two
millions
on
do
emancipate
too
fast
what
have
the
abolitionists
they
have
done
more
during
the
past
year
to
overthrow
the
system
of
slavery
than
has
been
accomplished
by
the
gradualists
in
half
a
century
they
have
succeeded
in
fastening
the
attention
of
the
nation
upon
its
enormities
and
in
piercing
the
callous
consciences
of
the
planters
they
are
reforming
and
consolidating
public
opinion
dispelling
the
mists
of
error
inspiring
the
hearts
of
the
timid
enlightening
the
eyes
of
the
blind
and
disturbing
the
slumbers
of
the
guilty
colonizationists
gather
a
few
leaves
which
the
tree
has
cast
off
and
vaunt
of
the
deed
abolitionists
the
axe
at
once
to
its
roots
and
put
their
united
nerve
into
the
steel
nor
shall
their
strokes
be
in
vain
for
soon
shall
great
of
lust
and
blood
and
of
all
abominable
and
heartless
iniquity
fall
before
them
and
law
and
love
and
god
and
man
shout
victory
over
its
ruin
has
the
reader
duly
considered
the
fatal
admissions
of
the
advocates
of
the
colonization
scheme
presented
in
the
preceding
pages
some
of
them
it
may
be
serviceable
to
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
to
recapitulate
society
does
not
aim
directly
at
the
instruction
of
the
blacks
their
moral
intellectual
and
political
improvement
within
the
united
states
is
foreign
to
its
public
safety
forbids
either
the
emancipation
or
the
general
instruction
of
the
society
properly
enough
stands
aloof
from
the
question
of

ready
to
pass
censure
upon
abolition
involves
no
intrusion
on
property
nor
even
upon

no

it

the
necessity
by
which
the

continuance
of

and
the
rigorous
provisions
for
its
maintenance
are

the
design
of
attempting
emancipation
either
partial
or

into
its
accounts
the
subject
of
emancipation
does
not
enter
at
all
it
has
no
intention
to
open
the
door
to
universal
rights
of
masters
are
to
remain
sacred
in
the
eyes
of
the
condemns
no
man
because
he
is
a
each
of
these
particulars
deserves
a
volume
of
comments
but
i
am
compelled
to
dismiss
them
in
rotation
with
a
single
remark
one
reason
assigned
by
the
society
for
refusing
to
promote
the
education
of
our
colored
population
is
a
dread
of
exciting
and
of
the
slaveholding
states
is
it
credible
as
far
then
as
this
society
extends
its
influence
more
than
two
millions
of
ignorant
degraded
beings
in
this
boasted
land
of
liberty
and
light
have
nothing
to
hope
their
moral
intellectual
and
political
improvement
is
foreign
to
its
powers
cruel
neglect
barbarous
coalition
a
sinful
fear
of
rousing
the
prejudices
of
oppressors
outweighs
the
claims
of
the
contemned
blacks
the
requirements
of
the
gospel
the
dictates
of
humanity
and
the
convictions
of
duty
will
this
plea
avail
aught
at
the
bar
of
god
millions
of
our
countrymen
purposely
kept
in
darkness
although
we
are
able
to
pour
daylight
upon
their
vision
merely
to
gratify
and
protect
their
buyers
and
sellers
there
never
was
a
more
abominable
or
more
absurd
heresy
propagated
than
the
assumption
that
the
public
safety
would
be
jeoparded
by
an
immediate
compliance
with
the
demands
of
justice
yet
it
has
obtained
among
all
orders
of
society
even
ministers
of
the
gospel
who
are
bound
to
cry
aloud
and
spare
not
to
lift
up
their
voices
like
a
trumpet
and
show
this
guilty
nation
its
sins
to
say
to
the
holders
of
slaves
the
bands
of
wickedness
undo
the
heavy
burdens
let
the
oppressed
go
free
break
every
even
they
fly
to
this
subterfuge
and
deprecate
a
general
emancipation
on
this
subject
know
not
what
they
do
they
reason
like
madmen
or
atheists
they
advance
sentiments
which
unhinge
the
moral
government
of
the
universe
and
directly
encourage
the
commission
of
the
most
heinous
crimes
how
long
would
any
one
of
their
number
retain
his
situation
if
he
were
to
preach
in
explicit
terms
to
his
congregation
as
follows
dear
hearers
if
any
among
you
are
daily
oppressing
the
weak
or
defrauding
the
poor
do
not
cease
from
your
robbery
and
cruelty
at
once
as
you
value
your
own
happiness
and
the
welfare
of
society
relax
your
tyrannous
grasp
gradually
from
the
throat
of
your
neighbor
and
steal
not
quite
so
much
from
him
this
year
as
you
did
the
last
but
they
emphatically
hold
this
language
whenever
they
advise
slaveholders
not
to
repent
or
too
hastily
the
public
safety
they
say
forbids
emancipation
or
in
other
words
the
public
safety
depends
upon
your
persistance
in
cheating
whipping
starving
debasing
your
slaves
nay
more
many
of
them
horrible
to
tell
are
traffickers
in
human
flesh
this
thing
which
it
can
not
bear
the
earth
is
disquieted
the
gospel
of
peace
and
mercy
preached
by
him
who
steals
buys
and
sells
the
purchase
of
messiah
blood
rulers
of
the
church
making
merchandize
of
their
brethren
souls
and
christians
trading
the
persons
of
men
i
the
system
of
slavery
is
full
of
danger
outrage
desolation
and
death
volcano
in
full
operation
a
monster
that
is
annually
supplied
with
sixty
thousand
new
victims
devoured
as
soon
as
born
and
yet
the
colonization
society
enough
stands
aloof
from
it
it
utters
no
lamentations
makes
no
supplications
gives
no
rebukes
presents
no
motives
for
repentance
the
society
is
not
only
ready
to
pass
but
it
is
constantly
bestowing
its
censure
upon
abolition
societies
it
represents
their
members
as
guided
by
a
visionary
wild
and
fanatical
spirit
as
invaders
of
rights
which
are
sacred
incendiaries
disturbers
of
the
peace
of
society
and
enemies
to
the
safety
and
happiness
of
the
planters
determining
itself
to
avoid
the
question
of
emancipation
to
leave
millions
of
human
beings
to
pine
in
bondage
without
exposing
the
guilt
of
the
oppressors
it
endeavors
to
prevent
any
other
association
agitating
the
subject
hence
between
colonization
and
abolition
societies
there
is
no
affinity
of
feeling
or
action
and
hence
arises
the
cause
inexplicable
to
many
why
they
can
not
pursue
their
objects
amicably
together
the
attempt
of
the
society
to
conciliate
the
holders
of
slaves
must
result
either
in
disappointment
or
in
an
abandonment
of
the
path
of
duty
if
they
are
guilty
of
robbery
and
oppression
they
must
be
arraigned
as
criminals
or
they
never
will
reform
for
why
should
honest
benevolent
men
change
their
conduct
if
through
a
false
delicacy
of
feeling
or
cringing
policy
their
wickedness
be
covered
up
alas
for
the
slaves
and
alas
for
the
regeneration
of
the
south
all
hope
is
lost
the
society
has
no
wish
it
to
interfere
with
the
system
of
slavery
monstrous
indifference
or
barbarous
cruelty
and
yet
it
presumes
to
occupy
the
whole
ground
of
the
controversy
and
to
direct
the
actions
of
the
friends
of
the
blacks
throughout
the
land
by
the
phrase
is
meant
no
desire
to
contest
the
claims
of
the
planters
to
their
bondmen
or
to
kindle
the
indignation
of
the
people
against
their
atrocious
practices
it
appears
that
all
those
terrible
enactments
which
have
been
made
for
the
government
of
the
slaves
such
for
example
as
forbid
their
learning
to
read
under
the
penalty
of
stripes
and
even
death
are
acknowledged
by
the
society
to
be
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
order
what
a
concession
sometimes
we
are
told
that
the
society
is
aiming
at
the
liberation
of
all
the
slaves
and
then
that
it
has
no
design
of
attempting
either
partial
or
general
emancipation
so
contradictory
are
its
assurances
it
is
manifest
that
it
does
not
mean
to
touch
the
question
of
slavery
and
hence
the
imperious
necessity
of
forming
abolition
societies
the
rights
of
masters
are
to
remain
sacred
in
the
eyes
of
the
society
what
rights
those
by
which
the
intelligent
creatures
of
god
are
bought
and
sold
and
used
like
cattle
those
which
are
founded
upon
piracy
cruelty
and
outrage
j
yes
this
then
is
an
abandonment
of
the
ground
of
right
and
justice
and
ends
the
controversy
between
truth
and
error
it
condemns
no
man
because
he
is
a
slaveholder
certainly
then
it
allows
that
slaveholders
are
upright
men
not
guilty
of
fraud
not
oppressors
not
extortioners
and
that
the
slaves
are
truly
and
justly
their
property
not
entitled
to
freedom
not
better
than
cattle
not
conscious
of
evil
treatment
not
worthy
of
remuneration
for
their
toil
not
rational
and
accountable
beings
footnotes
h
the
term
evil
is
used
here
in
a
criminal
sense
i
know
that
colonizationists
regard
slavery
as
an
evil
but
an
evil
which
has
been
upon
this
land
for
the
existence
of
which
we
are
no
more
to
blame
than
for

daring

that

the

the

of

of

one
comparison
with
which
the
condition
of
his

is

is
convinced
that
if
he
withdraws
from
his
slaves
his
authority
his
support
his
protection
and
leaves
them
to
shift

themselves
he
turns
them

a

rejoice
at

could
it
be
accomplished

the
entire
freedom

concession
which
transforms

leads
the

to
believe
that

his

something
more

declaim
against

and
wickedness

even
to
denounce

trade
but
the
unfortunate
blacks
are
not
now

never
can
be

that

inexplicably
increasing

exhausted
by

recommending

be

the
proportion
of
the
excess
of

population
it
would
be
necessary
to
throw
off
by
the
process
of
voluntary
manumission

this
effect
must
result
inevitably
from
the
depreciating

an
immense
bribe
into

hands
of

kidnap
rob

only
aim

anxiety
seem
to
be
prune

nourish
the

not
to
overthrow
it
to
increase
the
avarice
of
the
planters
by
rendering
the
labor
of
their
bondmen
more
productive
not
to
abridge
and
starve

manifestly
tends
to
quiet

i
regard
it
with
inexpressible
abhorrence
and
dismay
since
the
deception
practised
upon

that
shall
liberate
one

somewhat
less

surely
not

respect
their

too
much
to
believe
that
they
mean
any
such

if
any
of
the

should
be
exempted
from
sale
or
purchase
why
not
all
if

require
the
liberation
of
the

not
of
the

if
it
be
right
for
a
driver
to
inflict
a
number
of
lashes
how
many
shall
be
given
do
colonizationists
mean
that
the
practice
of
separating
the
husband
from
the
wife
the
wife
from
the
husband
or
children
from
their
parents
shall
come
to
an
end
by
an
almost
imperceptible
process
or
that
the
slaves
shall
be
defrauded
of
their
just
remuneration
less
and
less
every
month
or
every
year
or
that
they
shall
be
under
the
absolute
irresponsible
control
of
their
masters
oh
no
i
place
a
higher
value
upon
their
good
sense
humanity
and
morality
than
this
well
then
they
would
immediately
break
up
the
slave
traffic
they
would
put
aside
the
whip
they
would
have
the
marriage
relations
preserved
inviolate
they
would
not
separate
families
they
would
not
steal
the
wages
of
the
slaves
nor
deprive
them
of
personal
liberty
this
is
abolition
it
is
simply
declaring
that
slave
owners
are
bound
to
fulfil
now
without
any
reluctance
or
delays
the
golden
rule
namely
to
do
as
they
would
be
done
by
and
that
as
the
right
to
be
free
is
inherent
and
inalienable
in
the
slaves
there
ought
now
to
be
a
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
people
to
break
their
fetters
all
the
horrid
spectres
which
are
conjured
up
on
this
subject
arise
from
a
confusion
of
the
brain
as
much
as
from
a
corruption
of
the
heart
i
utterly
reject
as
delusive
and
dangerous
in
the
extreme
every
plea
which
justifies
a
procrastinated
and
an
indefinite
emancipation
or
which
concedes
to
a
slave
owner
the
right
to
hold
his
slaves
as
for
any
limited
period
or
which
contends
for
the
gradual
preparation
of
the
slaves
for
freedom
believing
all
such
pretexts
to
be
a
fatal
departure
from
the
high
road
of
justice
into
the
bogs
of
expediency
a
surrender
of
the
great
principles
of
equity
an
indefensible
prolongation
of
the
curse
of
slavery
a
concession
which
places
the
guilt
upon
any
but
those
who
incur
it
and
directly
calculated
to
perpetuate
the
thraldom
of
our
species
immediate
abolition
does
not
mean
that
the
slaves
shall
immediately
exercise
the
right
of
suffrage
or
be
eligible
to
any
office
or
be
emancipated
from
law
or
be
free
from
the
benevolent
restraints
of
guardianship
we
contend
for
the
immediate
personal
freedom
of
the
slaves
for
their
exemption
from
punishment
except
where
law
has
been
violated
for
their
employment
and
reward
as
free
laborers
for
their
exclusive
right
to
their
own
bodies
and
those
of
their
own
children
for
their
instruction
and
subsequent
admission
to
all
the
trusts
offices
honors
and
emoluments
of
intelligent
freemen
emancipation
will
increase
and
not
destroy
the
value
of
their
labor
it
will
also
increase
the
demand
for
it
holding
out
the
stimulus
of
good
treatment
and
an
adequate
reward
it
will
induce
the
slaves
to
toil
with
a
hundred
fold
more
assiduity
and
faithfulness
who
is
so
blind
as
not
to
perceive
the
peaceful
and
beneficial
results
of
such
a
change
the
slaves
if
freed
will
come
under
the
watchful
cognizance
of
law
they
will
not
be
idle
but
industrious
they
will
not
rush
through
the
country
firing
dwellings
and
murdering
the
inhabitants
for
freedom
is
all
they
ask
all
they
desire
the
obtainment
of
which
will
transform
them
from
enemies
into
friends
from
nuisances
into
blessings
from
a
corrupt
suffering
and
degraded
into
a
comparatively
virtuous
happy
and
elevated
population
nor
does
immediate
abolition
mean
that
any
compulsory
power
other
than
moral
should
be
used
in
breaking
the
fetters
of
slavery
it
calls
for
no
bloodshed
or
physical
interference
it
jealously
regards
the
welfare
of
the
planters
it
simply
demands
an
entire
revolution
in
public
sentiment
which
will
lead
to
better
conduct
to
contrition
for
past
crimes
to
a
love
instead
of
a
fear
of
justice
to
a
reparation
of
wrongs
to
a
healing
of
breaches
to
a
suppression
of
revengeful
feelings

a

prosperous
state
of

now
see
with
what
earnestness
and
inveteracy
the
friends
of
the
colonization
society
oppose
immediate
abolition

indeed
to
be
the
only
feasible
mode
by
which
we
can
remove
that
stigma
as
well
as
from
among
us
their
sudden
and
entire
freedom
would
be
a
fearful
and
perhaps
dreadful
experiment
destructive
of
all
the
ends
of
liberty
for
which
their
condition
would
unfit
them
and
which
they
would
doubtless
greatly
abuse
even
their
release
at
apparently
proper
intervals
but
uncontrolled
as
to
their
future
habits
and
location
would
be
a
very
hazardous
charity
their
gradual
emancipation
therefore
under
the
advantages
of
a
free
government
formed
in
their
native
land
by
their
own
hands
offering
all
the
rewards
usual
to
industry

economy

affording
the
means
of
enjoying
in

a
reputable

rational

them

also
in

ought
not

to
disentangle
themselves
from
the
obligations
which

sustain
his

as
little

appears
to
us
to
be
the
true
relation
of

southern
planters
to
their

not
that
the
southern
planters
have
generally
been
guilty
of
personal
cruelty
but
such
has
been
the
general
result
of
the
system
acted
upon
and
such
the
relation
growing
out

have
grown
up
under
the
eye
of
their
masters
unable
to
take

their
masters
for
whose
comfort
and
convenience
this
has
been
done
are

to
provide

do
we
think
that
the
exhortation
to
do
right
and
trust
providence
applies
at
all
to
this
case
for
the
very
question
is
what
is

would
it
be
right
for
the
slave
merchant
in

of

to
knock
the
manacles
from

prisoners

throw
them
overboard
and
call

giving
them
their
liberty
and
trusting
providence
with
the
result
but
how
else
could
he
reduce
the
doctrine
of
immediate
and
complete
emancipation
to
practice
vermont
chronicle
the
miserable
sophistry
contained
in
the
foregoing
extracts
scarcely
needs
a
serious
refutation
say
that
immediate
emancipation
will
only
increase
the
wretchedness
of
the
slaves
and
that
we
must
pursue
a
system
of
abolition
is
to
present
to
us
the
double
paradox
that
we
must
continue
to
do
evil
in
order
to
cure
the
evil
which
we
are
doing
and
that
we
must
continue
to
be
unjust
and
to
do
evil
that
good
may
come
the
fatal
error
of
lies
here
they
talk
as
if
the
friends
of
abolition
contended
only
for
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
without
specifying
or
caring
what
should
be
done
with
or
for
them
as
if
the
planters
were
invoked
to
cease
from
one
kind
of
villany
only
to
practise
another
as
if
the
manumitted
slaves
must
necessarily
be
driven
out
from
society
into
the
wilderness
like
wild
beasts
this
is
talking
nonsense
it
is
a
gross
perversion
of
reason
and
common
sense
abolitionists
have
never
said
that
mere
manumission
would
be
doing
justice
to
the
slaves
they
insist
upon
a
remuneration
for
years
of
unrequited
toil
upon
their
employment
as
free
laborers
upon
their
immediate
and
coefficient
instruction
and
upon
the
exercise
of
a
benevolent
supervision
over
them
on
the
part
of
their
employers
they
declare
in
the
first
place
that
to
break
the
fetters
of
the
slaves
and
turn
them
loose
upon
the
country
without
the
preservative
restraints
of
law
and
destitute
of
occupation
would
leave
the
work
of
justice
only
half
done
and
secondly
that
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
planters
would
be
wholly
independent
of
the
labor
of
the
blacks
for
they
could
no
more
dispense
with
it
next
week
were
emancipation
to
take
place
than
they
can
the
very
ground
which
they
assume
for
their
opposition
to
slavery
that
it
necessarily
prevents
the
improvement
of
its
victims
shows
that
they
contemplate
the
establishment
of
schools
for
the
education
of
the
slaves
and
the
furnishing
of
productive
employment
immediately
upon
their
liberation
if
this
were
done
none
of
the
horrors
which
are
now
so
feelingly
depicted
as
the
attendants
of
a
sudden
abolition
would
ensue
but
we
are
gravely
told
that
education
must
emancipation
the
logic
of
this
plea
is
that
intellectual
superiority
justly
gives
one
man
an
oppressive
control
over
another
where
would
such
a
detestable
principle
lead
but
to
practices
the
most
atrocious
and
results
the
most
disastrous
if
carried
out
among
ourselves
tell
us
ye
sophists
the
exact
quantum
of
knowledge
which
is
necessary
to
constitute
a
freeman
if
every
dunce
should
be
a
slave
your
servitude
is
inevitable
and
richly
do
you
deserve
the
lash
for
your
obtuseness
our
white
population
too
would
furnish
blockheads
enough
to
satisfy
all
the
classical
kidnappers
in
the
land
the
reason
why
the
slaves
are
so
ignorant
is
because
they
are
held
in
bondage
and
the
reason
why
they
are
held
in
bondage
is
because
they
are
so
ignorant
they
ought
not
to
be
freed
until
they
are
educated
and
they
ought
not
be
educated
because
on
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
they
would
burst
their
fetters
fine
logic
indeed
how
men
who
make
any
pretensions
to
honesty
or
common
sense
can
advance
a
paradox
like
this
is
truly
inexplicable
never
met
with
a
man
yet
says
an
able
writer
in
kentucky
impliedly
admits
the
enslaving
of
human
beings
as
consistent
with
the
exercise
of
christian
duties
who
could
talk
or
write
ten
minutes
on
the
subject
without
expressing
nonsense
or
contradicting
himself
or
advancing
heresy
which
would
expose
him
to
censure
on
any
other
subject
in
this
connexion
i
make
the
following
extract
from
the
report
of
the
negro
friend
of
which
wilberforce
is
president
and
clarkson
vice
president
do
not
recognize
the
false
principle
that
education
as
a
preparation
for
freedom
must
precede
emancipation
or
that
an
amelioration
of
the
slaves
condition
should
be
a
substitute
for
it
on
the
contrary
they
insist
upon
unprocrastinated
emancipation
as
a
right
which
is
unrighteously
withheld
and
the
restoration
of
which
is
in
their
opinion
the
first
and
most
indispensable
step
to
all
improvement
and
absolutely
essential
to
the
application
of
the
only
remedy
for
that
moral
debasement
in
which
slavery
has
sunk
its
victims
i
can
not
portray
the
absurdity
of
the
doctrine
of
gradual
abolition
and
the
danger
and
folly
of
attempting
to
mitigate
the
system
of
slavery
more
strikingly
than
by
presenting
the
following
eloquent
extracts
from
a
speech
of
the
rev
thomson
of
edinburgh
one
of
the
most
learned
and
able
divines
in
great
britain
whose
sudden
death
was
recorded
in
the
newspapers
a
few
months
since
word
may
no
doubt
be
considered
as
a
strong
word
but
you
will
observe
that
it
is
used
as
contrasted
with
the
word
and
were
i
to
criticise
the
term
as
certain
opponents
have
treated
the
term
i
could
easily
by
the
help
of
a
little
quibbling
bring
you
to
the
conclusion
that
as
hitherto
employed
it
means
that
the
abolition
is
never
to
take
place
and
that
by
putting
it
into
their
petition
they
are
to
be
understood
as
deprecating
rather
than
asking
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
they
argue
evanishes
as
soon
as
you
utter
it
it
is
gone
before
your
petition
reaches
parliament
how
absurd
if
i
should
say
to
my
servant
while
engaged
in
work
you
must
go
to
the
south
side
of
the
town
with
a
message
for
me
is
it
indeed
implied
in
the
order
i
have
given
him
that
he
could
not
fulfil
it
unless
he
set
off
without
his
hat
without
his
coat
without
his
shoes
without
those
habiliments
which
are
requisite
for
his
appearing
decently
in
the
streets
of
edinburgh
and
executing
the
task
that
i
had
assigned
him
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
used
by
us
is
perfectly
clear
and
can
not
be
misapprehended
by
any
one
it
is
not
to
be
made
a
subject
of
metaphysical
animadversion
it
is
to
be
considered
and
understood
under
the
direction
of
common
sense
and
especially
as
modified
and
expounded
by
those
statements
with
which
it
is
associated
both
in
our
resolutions
and
in
the
petition
and
viewed
in
that
light
is
not
merely
an
intelligible
phrase
but
one
that
does
not
warrant
a
particle
of
the
alarm
which
some
have
affected
to
take
at
it
and
is
not
liable
to
any
one
of
those
objections
which
some
have
been
pleased
to
make
to
it
say
that
we
will
come
out
of
the
sin
by
degrees
that
we
will
only
forsake
it
slowly
and
step
by
step
that
we
will
pause
and
hesitate
and
look
well
about
us
before
we
consent
to
abandon
its
gains
and
its
pleasures
that
we
will
allow
another
age
to
pass
by
ere
we
throw
off
the
load
of
iniquity
that
is
lying
so
heavy
upon
us
lest
certain
secularities
should
be
injuriously
affected
and
that
we
will
postpone
the
duty
of
doing
justly
and
loving
mercy
till
we
have
removed
every
petty
difficulty
out
of
the
way
and
got
all
the
conflicting
interests
that
are
involved
in
the
measure
reconciled
and
satisfied
to
say
this
is
to
trample
on
the
demands
of
moral
obligation
and
to
disregard
the
voice
which
speaks
to
as
from
heaven
the
path
of
duty
is
plain
before
us
and
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
enter
it
at
once
and
to
walk
in
it
without
turning
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
our
concern
is
not
with
the
result
that
may
follow
our
obedience
to
the
divine
will
our
great
and
primary
concern
is
to
obey
that
will
god
reigns
over
his
universe
in
the
exercise
of
infinite
perfection
he
commands
us
to
let
the
oppressed
go
free
and
to
break
every
yoke
and
submitting
without
procrastination
and
without
any
attempts
at
compromise
to
that
command
we
may
be
assured
that
he
will
take
care
of
all
the
effects
that
can
be
produced
by
compliance
with
his
authority
and
give
demonstration
to
the
truth
that
obedience
to
his
behests
is
our
grand
and
only
security
for
a
prosperous
lot
are
by
no
means
indifferent
to
the
expediency
of
the
case
on
the
contrary
we
think
ourselves
prepared
to
prove
by
fair
reasoning
and
by
ascertained
fact
that
the
expediency
of
the
thing
is
all
on
our
side
that
immediate
abolition
is
the
only
secure
and
proper
way
of
attaining
the
object
which
we
all
profess
to
have
in
view
that
to
defer
the
measure
to
a
distant
period
and
to
admit
the
propriety
of
getting
at
it
by
a
course
of
mitigation
is
the
surest
mode
of
frustrating
every
hope
we
might
otherwise
entertain
and
giving
over
the
slaves
to
interminable
bondage
do
not
deny
sir
that
the
evils
of
practical
slavery
may
be
lessened
by
parliamentary
enactments
by
colonial
arrangements
by
appeals
to
the
judgment
and
feelings
of
planters
and
by
various
other
means
a
certain
degree
of
melioration
be
secured
but
i
say
in
the
first
place
that
with
all
that
you
can
accomplish
or
reasonably
expect
of
mitigation
you
can
not
alter
the
nature
of
slavery
itself
with
every
improvement
you
have
superinduced
upon
it
you
have
not
made
it
less
debasing
less
cruel
less
destructive
in
its
essential
character
the
black
man
is
still
the
of
the
white
man
and
that
one
circumstance
not
only
implies
in
it
the
transgression
of
inalienable
right
and
everlasting
justice
but
is
the
fruitful
and
necessary
source
of
numberless
mischiefs
the
very
thought
of
which
harrows
up
the
soul
and
the
infliction
of
which
no
superintendence
of
any
government
can
either
prevent
or
control
mitigate
and
keep
down
the
evil
as
much
as
you
can
still
it
is
there
in
all
its
native
virulence
and
still
it
will
do
its
malignant
work
in
spite
of
you
the
improvements
you
have
made
are
merely
superficial
you
have
not
reached
the
seat
and
vital
spring
of
the
mischief
you
have
only
concealed
in
some
measure
and
for
a
time
its
inherent
enormity
its
essence
remains
unchanged
and
untouched
and
is
ready
to
unfold
itself
whenever
a
convenient
season
arrives
notwithstanding
all
your
precaution
and
all
you
vigilance
in
those
manifold
acts
of
injustice
and
inhumanity
which
are
its
genuine
and
its
invariable
fruits
you
may
the
sepulchre
you
may
put
upon
it
every
adornment
that
fancy
can
suggest
you
may
cover
it
over
with
all
the
flowers
and
evergreens
that
the
garden
or
the
fields
can
furnish
so
that
it
will
appear
beautiful
outwardly
unto
men
but
it
is
a
sepulchre
still
full
of
dead
men
bones
and
of
all
uncleanness
disguise
slavery
as
you
will
put
into
the
cup
all
the
pleasing
and
palatable
ingredients
which
you
can
discover
in
the
wide
range
of
nature
and
of
art
still
it
is
a
bitter
bitter
draught
from
which
the
understanding
and
the
heart
of
every
man
in
whom
nature
works
unsophisticated
and
unbiassed
recoils
with
unutterable
aversion
and
abhorrence
why
sir
slavery
is
the
very
upas
tree
of
the
moral
world
beneath
whose
pestiferous
shade
all
intellect
languishes
and
all
virtue
dies
and
if
you
would
get
quit
of
the
evil
you
must
go
more
thoroughly
and
effectually
to
work
than
you
can
ever
do
by
any
or
by
all
of
those
palliatives
which
are
included
under
the
term
mitigation
the
foul
sepulchre
must
be
taken
away
the
cup
of
oppression
must
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
ground
the
pestiferous
tree
must
be
cut
down
and
eradicated
it
must
be
root
and
branch
of
it
cast
into
the
consuming
fire
and
its
ashes
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
it
is
thus
you
must
deal
with
slavery
you
must
annihilate
it
annihilate
it
now
and
annihilate
it
for
ever
your
mitigation
i
say
in
the
second
place
that
you
are
thereby
in
all
probability
farther
away
than
ever
from
your
object
it
is
not
to
the
government
or
the
parliament
at
home
that
you
are
to
look
neither
is
it
to
the
legislatures
and
planters
abroad
that
you
are
to
look
for
accomplishing
the
abolition
of
negro
slavery
sad
experience
shows
that
if
left
to
themselves
they
will
do
nothing
efficient
in
this
great
cause
it
is
to
the
sentiments
of
the
people
at
large
that
you
are
to
look
to
the
spread
of
intellectual
light
to
the
prevalence
of
moral
feeling
to
the
progress
in
short
of
public
opinion
which
when
resting
on
right
principles
and
moving
in
a
right
direction
must
in
this
free
and
christian
country
prove
irresistible
but
observe
sir
the
public
mind
will
not
be
sufficiently
affected
by
the
statement
of
abstract
truths
however
just
or
by
reasonings
on
the
tendencies
of
a
system
however
accurate
it
must
be
more
or
less
influenced
by
what
is
visible
or
by
what
is
easily
known
and
understood
of
the
actual
atrocities
which
accompany
slavery
wherever
it
is
left
to
its
own
proper
operation
let
it
be
seen
in
its
native
vileness
and
cruelty
as
exhibited
when
not
interfered
with
by
the
hand
of
authority
and
it
excites
universal
and
unqualified
detestation
but
let
its
harsher
asperities
be
rubbed
off
take
away
the
more
prominent
parts
of
its
iniquity
see
that
it
look
somewhat
smoother
and
milder
than
it
did
before
make
such
regulations
as
ought
if
faithfully
executed
to
check
its
grosser
acts
of
injustice
and
oppression
give
it
the
appearance
of
its
being
put
under
the
humanizing
sway
of
religious
education
and
instruction
do
all
this
and
you
produce
one
effect
at
least
you
modify
the
indignation
of
a
great
number
of
the
community
you
render
slavery
much
less
obnoxious
you
enable
its
advocates
and
supporters
to
say
in
reply
to
your
denunciations
of
its
wickedness
o
the
slaves
are
now
comfortable
and
happy
they
do
not
suffer
what
they
did
they
are
protected
and
well
treated
and
in
proof
of
all
this
they
point
to
what
are
called
mitigations
but
mark
me
sir
under
these
mitigations
slavery
still
exists
ready
at
every
convenient
season
to
break
forth
in
all
its
countless
forms
of
inhumanity
meanwhile
the
public
feeling
in
a
great
measure
subsides
and
when
the
public
feeling
such
an
important
and
indispensable
element
in
our
attempts
to
procure
abolition
is
allowed
to
subside
tell
me
sir
when
and
where
and
by
what
means
it
is
again
to
be
roused
into
activity
i
must
say
for
one
that
though
i
sympathize
with
my
sable
brethren
when
i
hear
of
them
being
spared
even
one
lash
of
the
yet
when
i
take
a
more
enlarged
view
of
their
condition
when
i
consider
the
nature
of
that
system
under
which
they
are
placed
and
when
i
look
forward
to
their
deliverance
and
the
means
by
which
alone
it
is
to
be
effected
i
am
tempted
and
almost
if
not
altogether
persuaded
to
deprecate
that
insidious
thing
termed
mitigation
because
it
directly
tends
to
perpetuate
the
mighty
evil
which
will
by
and
by
throw
off
the
improvements
by
which
it
is
glossed
over
as
quite
unnatural
to
it
will
ultimately
grow
up
again
into
all
its
former
dreadfulness
and
continue
to
wither
and
crush
beneath
it
all
that
is
excellent
and
glorious
in
man
if
our
rulers
and
legislators
will
undertake
to
emancipate
the
slaves
and
do
it
as
it
ought
to
be
done
immediately
i
beg
those
who
set
themselves
against
such
a
measure
to
point
out
the
danger
and
to
prove
it
the
lies
upon
and
what
evidence
do
they
give
us
where
is
it
to
be
found
in
what
circumstance
shall
we
discover
it
from
what
principles
and
probabilities
shall
we
infer
it
we
must
not
have
mere
hypothesis
mere
allegations
mere
fancied
horrors
dressed
up
in
frightful
language
we
must
have
proof
to
substantiate
in
some
good
measure
their
theory
of
rebellion
warfare
and
blood
if
any
such
thing
exists
let
them
produce
it
if
you
push
me
and
still
urge
the
argument
of
insurrection
and
bloodshed
for
which
you
are
far
more
indebted
to
fancy
than
to
fact
as
i
have
shown
you
then
i
say
be
it
so
i
repeat
that
maxim
taken
from
a
heathen
book
but
pervading
the
whole
book
of
god
righteousness
sir
is
the
pillar
of
the
universe
break
down
that
pillar
and
the
universe
falls
into
ruin
and
desolation
but
preserve
it
and
though
the
fair
fabric
may
sustain
partial
dilapidations
it
may
be
rebuilt
and
repaired
it
be
rebuilt
and
repaired
and
restored
to
all
its
pristine
strength
and
magnificence
and
beauty
if
there
must
be
violence
let
it
even
come
for
it
will
soon
pass
away
let
it
come
and
rage
its
little
hour
since
it
is
to
be
succeeded
by
lasting
freedom
and
prosperity
and
happiness
give
me
the
hurricane
rather
than
the
pestilence
give
me
the
hurricane
with
its
thunder
and
its
lightning
and
its
tempest
give
me
the
hurricane
with
its
partial
and
temporary
devastations
awful
though
they
be
give
me
the
hurricane
with
its
purifying
healthful
salutary
effects
give
me
that
hurricane
infinitely
rather
than
the
noisome
pestilence
whose
path
is
never
crossed
whose
silence
is
never
disturbed
whose
progress
is
never
arrested
by
one
sweeping
blast
from
the
heavens
which
walks
peacefully
and
sullenly
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
breathing
poison
into
every
heart
and
carrying
havoc
into
every
home
enervating
all
that
is
strong
defacing
all
that
is
beautiful
and
casting
its
blight
over
the
fairest
and
happiest
scenes
of
human
life
and
which
from
day
to
day
and
from
year
to
year
with
intolerant
and
interminable
malignity
sends
its
thousands
and
its
tens
of
thousands
of
hapless
victims
into
the
and
grave
it
is
said
by
way
of
extenuation
that
the
present
owners
of
slaves
are
not
responsible
for
the
origin
of
this
system
i
do
not
arraign
them
for
the
crimes
their
but
for
the
constant
perpetration
and
extension
of
similar
crimes
the
plea
that
the
evil
of
slavery
was
entailed
upon
them
shall
avail
them
nothing
in
its
length
and
breadth
it
means
that
the
robberies
of
one
generation
justify
the
robberies
of
another
that
the
inheritance
of
stolen
property
converts
it
into
an
honest
acquisition
that
the
atrocious
conduct
of
their
fathers
exonerates
them
from
all
accountability
thus
presenting
the
strange
anomaly
of
a
race
of
men
incapable
of
incurring
guilt
though
daily
practising
the
vilest
deeds
scarcely
any
one
denies
that
blame
attaches
somewhere
the
present
generation
throws
it
upon
the
past
the
past
upon
its
predecessor
and
thus
it
is
cast
like
a
ball
from
one
to
another
down
to
the
first
importers
of
the
africans
that
be
in
the
temperate
zone
which
is
the
of
all
near
the
equator
can
that
be
in
one
meridian
of
longitude
which
at
one
hundred
degrees
east
is
the
of
sixty
thousand
infants
the
offspring
of
are
annually
born
in
this
country
and
doomed
to
remediless
bondage
is
it
not
as
atrocious
a
crime
to
kidnap
these
as
to
kidnap
a
similar
number
on
the
coast
of
africa
it
is
said
moreover
that
we
ought
to
legislate
prospectively
on
this
subject
that
the
fetters
of
the
present
generation
of
slaves
can
not
be
broken
and
that
our
single
aim
should
be
to
obtain
the
freedom
of
their
offspring
by
fixing
a
definite
period
after
which
none
shall
be
born
slaves
but
this
is
inconsistent
inhuman
and
unjust
the
following
extracts
from
the
speech
of
the
rev
thomson
are
conclusive
on
this
point
the
first
place
it
amounts
to
an
indirect
sanction
of
the
continued
slavery
of
all
who
are
now
alive
and
of
all
who
may
be
born
before
the
period
fixed
upon
this
is
a
renunciation
of
the
great
moral
principles
upon
which
the
demand
for
abolition
proceeds
it
consigns
more
than
human
beings
to
bondage
and
oppression
while
their
title
to
freedom
is
both
indisputable
and
acknowledged
and
it
is
not
merely
an
inconsistency
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
and
a
violation
of
the
duty
which
they
owe
to
such
a
multitude
of
their
but
it
weakens
or
surrenders
the
great
argument
by
which
they
enforce
their
application
for
the
extinction
of
colonial
slavery
it
is
vain
to
expect
that
the
planters
will
acquiesce
in
such
a
prospective
measure
any
more
than
in
the
liberation
of
the
existing
slaves
for
the
progeny
of
the
existing
slaves
must
be
considered
by
them
as
much
a
part
of
their
property
as
these
slaves
themselves
and
they
would
regard
it
equally
unjust
to
deprive
them
of
what
is
hereafter
to
be
produced
from
their
own
slave
stock
as
it
would
be
to
deprive
a
farmer
by
an
anticipating
law
of
all
the
foals
and
of
all
the
calves
that
might
be
produced
in
his
stable
and
in
his
after
a
given
specified
date
must
be
true
to
our
own
maxims
which
are
taken
from
the
word
of
god
and
ask
for
all
that
we
are
entitled
to
have
on
the
ground
of
justice
and
humanity
and
be
contented
with
nothing
less
the
second
place
the
plan
objected
to
is
not
merely
an
acquiescence
in
the
continuance
of
crime
it
is
a
violation
of
the
best
feelings
of
our
nature
for
let
any
man
but
reflect
on
the
circumstance
of
children
being
born
to
slavery
merely
because
they
came
into
the
world
the
last
hour
of
december
instead
of
the
first
hour
of
january
and
of
children
in
the
same
family
brothers
and
sisters
some
of
them
destined
to
bondage
for
life
and
others
gifted
with
freedom
for
no
other
reason
than
that
the
former
were
born
before
and
the
latter
after
a
particular
day
of
a
particular
year
and
of
parents
being
unjustly
and
inhumanly
flogged
in
the
very
sight
of
their
offspring
arbitrarily
made
free
while
they
are
as
arbitrarily
kept
slaves
let
any
man
but
reflect
on
those
things
and
unless
the
sensibilities
of
his
heart
be
paralysed
even
to
deadness
he
must
surely
revolt
at
such
a
cruel
and
cold
blooded
allotment
in
the
fortune
of
those
little
ones
and
be
satisfied
with
nothing
short
of
the
emancipation
of
the
whole
community
without
a
single
exception
the
third
place
supposing
all
children
born
after
january
were
declared
free
how
are
they
to
be
educated
that
they
may
be
prepared
for
the
enjoyment
of
that
liberty
with
which
you
have
invested
them
they
must
undergo
a
particular
and
appropriate
training
so
say
the
very
well
under
whom
are
they
to
get
this
training
are
they
to
be
separated
from
their
parents
is
that
dearest
of
natural
ties
to
be
broken
asunder
is
this
necessary
for
your
plan
and
are
not
you
thus
endeavoring
to
cure
one
species
of
wickedness
by
the
instrumentality
of
another
but
if
they
are
to
be
left
with
their
parents
and
brought
up
under
their
care
then
either
they
will
be
imbued
with
the
faults
and
degeneracies
that
are
characteristic
of
slavery
and
consequently
be
as
unfit
for
freedom
as
those
who
have
not
been
disenthralled
or
they
will
be
well
nurtured
and
well
instructed
by
their
parents
and
this
implies
a
confession
that
their
parents
themselves
are
sufficiently
prepared
for
liberty
and
that
there
is
no
good
reason
for
withholding
from
them
the
boon
that
is
bestowed
upon
their
children
view
in
short
we
take
of
the
question
the
prospective
plan
is
full
of
difficulty
or
contradictions
and
we
are
made
more
sensible
than
ever
that
there
is
nothing
left
for
us
but
to
take
the
consistent
honest
uncompromising
course
of
demanding
the
abolition
of
slavery
with
respect
to
the
present
as
well
as
to
every
future
generation
of
the
negroes
in
our
colonies
we
are
told
that
is
not
right
that
men
should
be
free
when
their
freedom
will
prove
injurious
to
themselves
and
others
this
has
been
the
plea
of
tyrants
in
all
ages
if
the
immediate
emancipation
of
the
slaves
would
prove
a
curse
it
follows
that
slavery
is
a
blessing
and
that
it
can
not
be
unjust
but
benevolent
to
defraud
the
laborer
of
his
hire
to
rank
him
as
a
beast
and
to
deprive
him
of
his
liberty
but
this
every
one
must
see
is
at
war
with
common
sense
and
avowedly
doing
evil
that
good
may
come
this
plea
must
mean
either
that
a
state
of
slavery
is
more
favorable
to
the
growth
of
virtue
and
the
dispensation
of
knowledge
than
a
state
of
freedom
a
glaring
absurdity
or
that
an
immediate
compliance
with
the
demands
of
justice
would
be
most
unjust
a
gross
contradiction
it
is
boldly
asserted
by
some
colonizationists
that
negroes
are
happier
when
kept
in
and
that
condition
of
the
great
mass
of
emancipated
africans
is
one
in
comparison
with
which
the
condition
of
the
slaves
is
what
is
the
inference
why
either
that
slavery
is
not
oppression
another
paradox
or
that
real
benevolence
demands
the
return
of
the
free
people
of
color
to
their
former
state
of
servitude
every
kidnapper
therefore
is
a
true
philanthropist
our
legislature
should
immediately
offer
a
bounty
for
the
body
of
every
free
colored
person
the
colored
population
of
massachusetts
at
for
each
man
woman
and
child
would
bring
at
least
million
three
hundred
thousand
this
sum
would
seasonably
replenish
our
exhausted
treasury
the
whole
free
colored
population
of
the
united
states
at
the
same
price
which
is
a
low
estimate
would
be
worth
millions
of
think
how
many

build

not
they
dare
not

they
believe
that
the
law
of

has
a
higher
claim
upon
their
obedience
than
the
laws
of
their
native
state
now
suppose
all
the
owners
of
slaves
in
our
land
should
be
suddenly
and
simultaneously
convicted
of
sin
and
moved
to
repentance
in
a
similar
manner
and
should
say
to
their
slaves
forbid
that
we
should
longer
call
you
our
property
or
place
you
on
a
level
with
our
cattle
or
defraud
you
of
your

are

we
need

suppose
i

a
case
like
this
should
happen

should
surround
these
penitent
oppressors

cry
the

be
cut

pillaged

will
stalk
through

you

your
mad
purpose

hearken

than
unto

judge
ye
here
would
be
presented
a
strange
spectacle
indeed
one
party
confessing
and
resolving
to
forsake
their
sins
and
another
urging
them
to
disregard
the
admonitions
of

and
to
leave
off

be
sure
a
few
a
very

who

concerning

absolutely
disregard
the
nature
and
constitution
of
man
as
also
his
inalienable
rights
and
annihilate
or
reverse
the
causes
and
effects
of
human
action
they
are
continually
fearful
lest
the
slaves
in
consequence
of
their
grievous
wrongs
and
intolerable
sufferings
should
attempt
to
gain
their
freedom
by
revolution
and
yet
they
affect
to
be
equally
fearful
lest
a
general
emancipation
should
produce
the
same
disastrous
consequences
how
absurd
they
that
oppression
must
cause
rebellion
and
yet
they
pretend
that
a
removal
of
the
cause
will
produce
a
bloody
effect
this
is
to
suppose
an
effect
without
a
cause
and
of
course
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
bestow
upon
the
slaves
personal
freedom
and
all
motives
for
insurrection
are
destroyed
treat
them
like
rational
beings
and
you
may
surely
expect
rational
treatment
in
return
treat
them
like
beasts
and
they
will
behave
in
a
beastly
manner
besides
precedent
and
experience
make
the
ground
of
abolitionists
invulnerable
in
no
single

be
said
to
hang
upon
this
point
if

slavery

the

see
this
most
clearly
they
see
that
while
you
allow
these

to
be
their
you
act
inconsistently

oppressively

intermeddling
as
you
propose
to
do
with
what

therefore
in

you

defeat
all

get
at

remarks
the
phrase
terrors
by
which
i
mean
that
throughout
all
the
speeches
addresses
and
reports
in
behalf
of
the
society
it
is
confessed
in
language
strong
and
explicit
that
an
irrepressible
and
agonizing
fear
of
the
influence
of
the
free
people
of
color
over
the
slave
population
is
the
primary
essential
and
prevalent
motive
for
colonizing
them
on
the
coast
of
africa
and
not
as
we
are
frequently
urged
to
believe
a
desire
simply
to
meliorate
their
condition
and
civilize
that
continent
on
this
point
the
evidence
is
abundant
reflecting
on
the
utility
of
a
plan
for
colonizing
the
free
people
of
color
with
whom
our
country
abounds
it
is
natural
that
we
should
be
first
struck
by
its
tendency
to
confer
a
benefit
on
ourselves
by
ridding
us
of
a
population
for
the
most
part
idle
and
useless
and
too
often
vicious
and
mischievous
a
class
must
evidently
be
a
burden
and
a
nuisance
to
the
community
and
every
scheme
which
affords
a
prospect
of
removing
so
great
an
evil
must
deserve
to
be
most
favorably
considered
it
is
not
in
themselves
merely
that
the
free
people
of
color
are
a
nuisance
and
burthen
they
contribute
greatly
to
the
corruption
of
the
slaves
and
to
aggravate
the
evils
of
their
condition
by
rendering
them
idle
discontented
and
disobedient
this
also
arises
from
the
necessity
under
which
the
free
blacks
are
of
remaining
incorporated
with
the
slaves
of
associating
habitually
with
them
and
forming
part
of
the
same
class
in
society
the
slave
seeing
his
free
companion
live
in
idleness
or
subsist
however
scantily
or
precariously
by
occasional
and
desultory
employment
is
apt
to
grow
discontented
with
his
own
condition
and
to
regard
as
tyranny
and
injustice
the
authority
which
compels
him
to
labor
p
however
as
the
benefits
are
which
we
may
thus
promise
ourselves
from
the
colonization
of
the
free
people
of
color
by
its
tendency
to
prevent
the
discontent
and
corruption
of
our
slaves
considerations
stated
in
the
first
part
of
this
letter
have
long
since
produced
a
thorough
conviction
in
my
mind
that
the
existence
of
a
class
of
free
people
of
color
in
this
country
is
highly
injurious
to
the
whites
the
slaves
and
the
free
people
of
color
themselves
consequently
that
all
emancipation
to
however
small
an
extent
which
permits
the
persons
emancipated
to
remain
in
this
country
is
an
evil
which
must
increase
with
the
increase
of
the
operation
and
would
become
altogether
intolerable
if
extended
to
the
whole
or
even
to
a
very
large
part
of
the
black
population
i
am
therefore
strongly
opposed
to

every
shape
and

not

from

may
be
safely
assumed
that
there
is
not
an
individual
in

given
to
the

a
consideration
who
does
not
regard
the
existence
of

the
bosom
of

an
evil
of
immense
magnitude

of
a
dangerous
and
alarming
tendency
their
abject
and
miserable
condition
is
too
obvious
to
be
pointed
out
all
must
perceive
it
and
perceiving
it
can
not
but
lament
it
but
their
deplorable
condition
is
not
more
obvious
to
the
most
superficial
observer
than
is
what
is
far
worse
and
still
more
to
be
dreaded
the
powerful
and
resistless
influence
which
they
exert
over
the
slave
population
while
their
character
remains
what
it
now
is
and
the
laws
and
structure
of
the
country
in
which
they
reside
prevent
its
permanent
improvement
this
influence
must
of
necessity
be
baneful

contaminating

themselves
like
the
deadly
upas
they
impart
corruption
to
all
around
them
their
numbers
too
are
constantly
and
rapidly
augmenting
their
annual
increase
is
truly
astonishing
certainly
unexampled
the
dangerous
ascendency
which
they
have
already
acquired
over
the
slaves
is
consequently
increasing
with
every
addition
to
their
numbers
and
every
addition
to
their
numbers
is
a
subtraction
from
the

and
happiness
and
safety
of
the
country
and
if
this
be
true
as
it
unquestionably
is
the
converse
is
also
true
the
danger
of
their
undue
influence
will
lessen
with
every
diminution
of
their
numbers
and
every
diminution
of
their
numbers
must
add

add
greatly
to

is
the

would
ask
whence
have
the
troubles
which
have
taken
place
among
the
slaves
of
louisiana
originated
trace
the
causes
and
we
will
invariably
find
them
to
have
proceeded
from
the
suggestions
and
officious
interferences
of
the
free
blacks
their
very
existence
in
our
limits
enjoying
supposed
independence
excites
the
envy
and
dissatisfaction
of
the
slaves
the
latter
naturally
inquire
why
is
it
that
persons
of
the
same
color
are
permitted
to
possess
more
privileges
than
they
do
we
know
the
danger
to
which
we
are
exposed
from
such
a
class
of
beings
living
in
the
very
heart
of
our
population

do

to

their
colored
population
i
refer
to
their
condition
whether
bond
or

they
are
wretched
and
dangerous
and
should
be
removed
and
the
danger
arises
not
because
we
have
thousands
of
slaves
within
our

because
there
are

address
by
gabriel
disosway
esq
is
not
now
a
novel
or
a
debateable
proposition
that
slavery
is
a
great
moral
and
political
curse
it
is
equally
clear
that
its
multitudinous
evils
are
greatly
increased
by
the
existence
among
us
of
a
mongrel
population
who
freed
from
the
shackles
of
bondage
yet
bear
about
them
the
badge
of
inferiority
stamped
upon
them
indelibly
by
the
hand
of
nature
and
are
therefore
deprived
of
those
rights
of
citizenship
without
which
they
must
necessarily
be
a
degraded
caste
depraved
in
morals
and
vicious
in
conduct
and
a
mischievous
and
dangerous
influence
over
those
to
whom
they
are
nominally
their
mere
existence
among
the
slaves
is
sufficient
of
itself
to
excite
in
the
bosoms
of
the
latter
a
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
with
their
own
condition
apparently
worse
because
of
the
coercion
to
labor
which
it
imposes
but
essentially
better
because
of
the
comforts
which
that
labor
procures
and
of
which
the
idle
and
dissolute
habits
of
the
free
negro
almost
invariably
deprive
him
the
slave
however
is
not
capable
of
reasoning
correctly
if
he
reasons
at
all
on
these
truths
he
envies
the
free
negro
his
idleness
and
his
freedom
from
restraint
with
all
its
attendant
disadvantages
of
poverty
and
disease
crime
and
punishment
and
hence
he
will
sometimes
indulge
the
delusive
dream
of
effecting
his
own
emancipation
by
the
murder
of
those
who
hold
him
in
bondage
take
away
from
him
this
cause
of
dissatisfaction
and
this
incentive
to
insurrection
and
then
these
impracticable
hopes
which
now
sometimes
flit
before
his
imagination
will
no
longer
embitter
his
hours
of
labor
and
urge
him
to
the
commission
of
those
horrid
deeds
of
massacre
which
though
they
may
glut
a
momentary
revenge
must
result
disastrously
not
only
to
the
slaves
engaged
immediately
in
their
perpetration
but
to
all
that
unfortunate
race
our
true
interests
require
that
they
shall
remove
from
among
us
and
no
longer
be
a
source
of
disquietude
to
the
whites
envy

and
of
degradation

believe
that
their
numbers
would
not

would
diminish

the
number
removed
might
be
increased

the

altogether
inadequate
to

contempt
in
view
of
such
a

there
is
a
deep
sense
of

an
awful
dread
of
retribution
manifested
in
the
foregoing
extracts
but
we
perceive
no
evidence
of
contrition
for

or
present
injustice
on
the
part
of
those
plotters

of

of
resolving
to
break
the
yoke
of
servitude
and
let

oppressed
go

it
seems
to
be
their
only
anxiety

aim
to
outwit
the
vengeance
of
heaven
and
strengthen
the
bulwarks
of
tyranny
by
expelling
the
free
people
of

from
our
shores
and
effecting
such
a
diminution
of
the
number
of

as
shall
give
the

a
triumphant
and
irresistible
superiority
the
increase

retain

as

able
by
this
prudent
device
to
oppress

rob

impunity
our
present
wailing
is
not
for
our
heinous
crimes
but
only
because

avarice
and
cruelty
have
carried

i

repentance

there
are
several
points
upon
which
i
wish
to
fasten
the
attention
of
the
reader
the
inhumanity
and
craftiness
of
these
propositions
for
the
removal
of
the
free
people
of
color
it
will
be
seen
that
the
conspirators
have
taxed
their
ingenuity
to
the
utmost
to
ascertain
the
exact
number
of
emigrants
which
must
be
transported
annually
the
amount
of
money
that
must
be
raised
the
persons
that
must
be
selected
the
number
of
vessels
that
must
be
employed
it
is
their
determination
if
the
necessary
means
can
be
obtained
to
transport
the
annual
increase
of
our
colored
population
but
in
this
calculation
we
find
no
allowance
made
for
unwillingness
or
resistance
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
the
objects
of
their
supervision
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
all
will
be
induced
to
go
into
exile
or
must
be
made
willing
compulsorily
nothing
else
is
contemplated
but
their
entire
expulsion
in
order
to
insure
a
reduction
of
this
increase
and
effectually
to
check
the
fruitfulness
of
generation
even
the
unmanly
and
scandalous
proposition
is
made
to
remove
principally
those
of
both
sexes
who
are
just
come
to
the
age
of
puberty
the
system
of
established
by
napoleon
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
a
successful
conspiracy
was
not
more
detestable
and
observant
than
is
this
violent
and
unnatural
project
young
were
encouraged
to
go
why
then
they
could
not
propagate
here
infamous
calculation
the
principal
object
avowed
for
the
removal
of
the
free
people
of
color
is
their
corruptive
and
dangerous
influence
over
the
slave
population
it
is
demonstrated
then
beyond
disputation
that
this
removal
will
infuse
new
strength
into
the
tottering
system
of
slavery
tighten
the
grasp
of
the
masters
upon
the
throats
of
the
slaves
lull
them
into
a
profound
and
quiet
sleep
postpone
the
hour
of
emancipation
and
enhance
the
security
and
value
of
slave
property
the
terror
of
mind
which
calls
for
this
separation
can
not
be
benevolence
and
the
combination
which
seeks
to
effect
it
can
not
merit
support
it
were
folly
to
hope
that
the
owners
of
slaves
will
ultimately
emancipate
them
from
conscientious
motives
in
the
first
place
they
affect
to
be
innocent
in
holding
their
victims
in
servitude
secondly
they
are
assured
by
their
colonization
brethren
that
they
are
not
guilty
of
oppression
but
on
the
contrary
are
watchful
guardians
and
lastly
they
are
obstinate
in
shutting
their
eyes
upon
the
light
and
kindle
into
a
rage
on
being
arraigned
for
their
tyrannous
conduct
our
only
ground
of
hope
then
is
in
increasing
the
difficulty
of
holding
their
slaves
in
multiplying
the
causes
of
their
apprehensions
in
destroying
the
value
of
slave
labor
and
in
making
their
situation
full
of
disquietude
and
distress
such
a
course
is
not
inconsistent
with
benevolence
such
a
course
we
are
obligated
to
pursue
as
we
value
the
present
and
everlasting
welfare
of
the
oppressor
and
the
oppressed
and
desire
to
have
a
conscience
void
of
offence
toward
god
and
toward
man
it
may
it
be
effected
by
a
scrupulous
abstinence
from
the
productions
of
slavery
by
encouraging
planters
to
cultivate
their
lands
by
the
hands
of
free
laborers
by
educating
our
free
colored
population
and
placing
them
on
an
equality
with
ourselves
and
by
constantly
exhibiting
the
criminality
of
holding
rational
and
immortal
beings
in
servile
bondage
thus
and
thus
only
shall
we
be
able
to
liberate
our
enslaved
countrymen
consider
the
inevitable
consequence
of
these
reiterated
and
malignant
statements
with
regard
to
the
habits
and
designs
of
the
free
people
of
color
first
it
deters
a
large
number
of
masters
from
liberating
their
slaves
and
hence
directly
perpetuates
the
evils
of
slavery
it
deters
them
for
two
reasons
an
unwillingness
to
augment
the
wretchedness
of
those
who
are
in
servitude
by
turning
them
loose
upon
the
country
and
a
dread
of
increasing
the
number
of
their
enemies
it
creates
and
nourishes
the
bitterest
animosity
against
the
free
blacks
it
has
spread
an
alarm
among
all
classes
of
society
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
acting
under
this
fearful
impulse
they
begin
to
persecute

severe

therefore
be
this
their
alternative
either
to

a
despicable

in

hence
the

hence
too
the

every

never

the
degradation

assertion
that

of

too
ludicrous

need
a
serious
refutation
corrupt
the
morals
of
those
who
are
recognized

treated
as
brutes
and
who
know
as
little

as

immaculate
creatures
the
system
of
slavery
is
constantly
developing
new
excellencies
it
is
we
now
perceive
the
protector
of
virtue
the
enemy
of
vice
and
a
purifier
of
the
soul
but
something
more
indiscreet
and
preposterous
than
this
is
advanced
for
our
admiration
we
are
gravely
assured
first
by
a
clergyman
that
generally
the
condition
of
the
free
man
of
color
one
in
comparison
with
which
the
condition
of
the
slave
is
and
secondly
by
the
last
distinguished
convert
to
the
colonization
society
the
hon
archer
of
virginia
condition
of
the
slave
is
thousand
the
best
the
disparity
is
wonderful
instead
of
and
q
let
us
draw
a
brief
comparison
the
limbs
of
the
free
black
are
fetterless
he
is
controlled
by
no
brutal
driver
he
bleeds
not
under
the
lash
he
is
his
own
master
his
wife
and
children
can
not
be
torn
from
his
arms
he
enjoys
the
fruits
of
his
own
labor
he
can
improve
his
own
mind
make
his
own
bargains
manage
his
own
business
go
from
place
to
place
and
assert
his
own
rights
the
situation
and
privileges
of
the
slave
are
exactly
the
reverse
reader
are
they
thousand
times
the
best
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
former
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
there
are
no
instances
in
which
the
slave
fares
as
well
as
the
free
man
of
color
but
the
argument
of
these
apologists
implies
that
a
state
of
slavery
is
superior
to
a
state
of
freedom
or
it
is
worthless
it
appears
from
the
quotations
that
have
been
given
that
the
only
reason
why
the
free
blacks
are
not
colonized
in
the
west
or
in
canada
or
hayti
or
mexico
is
because
their
proximity
to
the
slave
states
might
prove
detrimental
if
they
could
be
sent
to
any
or
to
all
these
places
without
any
danger
to
ourselves
why
then
all
objections
would
cease
this
confession
places
the
hypocrisy
of
this
society
in
bold
relief
it
pretends
to
be
anxious
to
evangelize
benighted
africa
and
stop
the
slave
trade
but
only
assure
it
that
the
blacks
may
be
safely
colonized
nearer
home
and
africa
might
still
continue
to
grope
in
darkness
and
the
slave
trade
to
increase
in
enormity
and
its
bowels
of
compassion
would
speedily
cease
to
yearn
hence
it
is
that
the
rapid
enlargement
of
the
wilberforce
settlement
in
upper
canada
so
disturbs
the
repose
of
the
advocates
of
african
colonization
and
many
of
them
would
rejoice
at
its
overthrow

of

magnitude
the
transportation

millions
of

a
remote

is
indeed
an
object
of
formidable
aspect
it
obviously
can
not
be
accomplished
at

that
the

be
gradually

be
made

is
believed
from

little
arithmetical
calculation

been

that
the
entire
shipping
of
the
country
both
public
and
private
would
hardly
be
competent
for
an
object
of
this
magnitude
but
careful
calculation
has
proved
that
one
eighteenth
of
the
mercantile
shipping
alone
entirely
devoted
to
the
enterprise
is
competent
to
carry
it
into
complete
consummation

why
might
not
our
brilliant

humane

not

indeed
it
is
if
shipping
enough
could
be
found
half
a
century

to
reduce
hundreds
of
thousands
of
this
race
in
a
single
year
to
a
wretched
vassalage
and
in
this
age
of
augmented
light
and
wealth
and
improvement
in
every
art
enough
can
not
be

we

it

find

that
unless

out

the

the

which

must
continue

without

can
hope
for

suffer

treacherous

will
compel

the

age
from
these
shores
they
have
never
wandered
they
are
the
descendants
of
those
who
were
forcibly
torn
from
africa
two
centuries
ago
their
fathers
assisted
in
breaking
the
yoke
of
british
oppression
and
achieving
that
liberty
which
we
prize
above
all
price
and
they
cherish
the
strongest
attachment
to
the
land
of
their
birth
now
as
they
could
not
have
been
born
in
two
countries
and
as
they
were
certainly
born
here
it
follows
that
africa
is
not
their
native
home
and
consequently
that
the
society
has
dealt
in
romance
or
something
more
culpable
in
representing
them
as
strangers
and
aliens
it
might
as
rationally
charge
them
with
being
natives
of
asia
or
europe
or
with
having
descended
from
the
regions
of
the
moon
to
see
ourselves
gravely
represented
in
a
british
periodical
as
natives
of
great
britain
i
doubt
not
would
create
great
merriment
and
a
scheme
for
our
transportation
would
add
vastly
to
our
sport
we
are
told
has
put
a
mark
upon
the
black
man
true
and
he
has
also
put
a
mark
upon
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
world
so
that
every
one
differs
in
appearance
from
another
is
easily
identified
and
to
make
the
objection
valid
should
occupy
a
portion
of
territory
be
himself
a
nation
enact
his
own
laws
and
live
in
perpetual
solitude
the
difference
between
a
black
and
a
white
skin
is
not
greater
than
that
between
a
white
and
a
black
one
in
either
case
the
mark
is
distinctive
and
the
blacks
may
as
reasonably
expel
the
whites
as
the
whites
the
blacks
to
make
such
a
separation
we
have
no
authority
to
attempt
it
would
end
only
in
disappointment
and
if
it
were
carried
into
effect
those
who
are
clamorous
for
the
measure
would
be
among
the
first
to
be
cast
out
the
creator
having
of
all
nations
of
men
to
dwell
on
all
the
face
of
the
earth
it
is
proper
for
them
to
associate
freely
together
and
he
is
a
proud
worm
of
the
dust
who
is
ashamed
to
acknowledge
this
common
relationship
again
we
are
told
god
of
nature
intended
the
blacks
should
be
a
community
but
has
he
been
frustrated
in
his
intentions
where
is
the
proof
of
such
purpose
let
us
have
something
more
than
the
of
the
society
yes
we
are
seriously
assured
that
nature
has
played
falsely
colored
persons
were
born
by
mistake
in
this
country
they
should
have
been
born
in
africa
we
must
therefore
rectify
the
error
with
all
despatch
by
transporting
them
to
their
truly
a
most
formidable
enterprise
there
occur
at
least
sixty
thousand
of
such
annually
while
the
society
has
corrected
only
about
two
thousand
in
fourteen
years
but
courage
men
engaged
in
a
laudable
enterprise
should
never
despair
there
are
some
difficulties
however
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
mighty
task
which
can
not
be
easily
overcome
granting
the
position
assumed
by
colonizationists
that
the
and
the
should
occupy
different
countries
how
do
they
intend
to
dispose
of
that
numerous
and
rapidly
increasing
class
who
are
neither
white
nor
black
called
mulattoes
we
have
not
been
informed
to
what
country
they
belong
but
the
point
ought
to
be
settled
before
any
classification
be
made
colonizationists
must
define
moreover
the
exact
shade
of
color
which
is
to
retain
or
banish
individuals
for
every
candid
mind
will
admit
that
it
would
be
as
unnatural
to
send
blood
to
africa
as
to
keep
blood
in
america
the
color
of
the
skin
is
to
give
construction
to
our
constitution
and
laws
let
us
at
once
begin
the
work
of
excision
let
us
raise
an
army
of
pure
whites
if
such
an
army
can
be
found
and
let
us
drive
out
and
transport
to
foreign
climes
men
women
and
children
who
can
not
bring
the
most
satisfactory
vouchers
that
their
veins
are
flowing
with
the
purest
english
blood
indeed
let
us
shut
up
our
ports
against
our
own
mariners
who
are
returning
from
an
india
voyage
and
whose
cheeks
and
muscles
could
not
wholly
withstand
the
influence
of
the
breezes
and
tropics
to
which
they
were
exposed
let
us
make
every
shade
of
complexion
every
difference
of
stature
and
every
contraction
of
a
muscle
a
shibboleth
to
detect
and
cut
off
a
brother
ephraimite
at
the
fords
of
jordan
though
such
a
crusade
would
turn
every
man
sword
against
his
fellow
yet
it
might
establish
the
right
of
precedence
to
different
features
statures
and
colors
and
oblige
some
friends
of
colonization
to
test
the
feasibility
and
equity
of
their
own
scheme
if
i
must
become
a
colonizationist
i
insist
upon
being
consistent
there
must
be
no
disagreement
between
my
creed
and
practice
i
must
be
able
to
give
a
reason
why
all
our
tall
citizens
should
not
conspire
to
remove
their
more
diminutive
brethren
and
all
the
corpulent
to
remove
the
lean
and
lank
and
all
the
strong
to
remove
the
weak
and
all
the
educated
to
remove
the
ignorant
and
all
the
rich
to
remove
the
poor
as
readily
as
for
the
removal
of
those
whose
skin
is
colored
like
my
own
for
nature
has
sinned
as
culpably
in
diversifying
the
size
as
the
complexion
of
her
progeny
and
fortune
in
the
distribution
of
her
gifts
has
been
equally
fickle
i
can
not
perceive
that
i
am
more
excusable
in
desiring
the
banishment
of
my
neighbor
because
his
skin
is
darker
than
mine
than
i
should
be
in
desiring
his
banishment
because
he
is
a
smaller
or
feebler
man
than
myself
surely
it
would
be
sinful
for
a
black
man
to
repine
and
murmur
and
impeach
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
god
because
he
was
made
with
a
sable
complexion
and
dare
i
be
guilty
of
such
an
impeachment
by
persecuting
him
on
account
of
his
color
i
dare
not
i
would
as
soon
deny
the
existence
of
my
creator
as
quarrel
with
the
workmanship
of
his
hands
i
rejoice
that
he
has
made
one
star
to
differ
from
another
star
in
glory
that
he
has
not
given
to
the
sun
the
softness
and
gentleness
of
the
moon
nor
to
the
moon
the
intensity
and
magnificence
of
the
sun
that
he
presents
to
the
eye
every
conceivable
shape
and
aspect
and
color
in
the
gorgeous
and
multifarious
productions
of
nature
and
i
do
not
rejoice
less
but
admire
and
exalt
him
more
that
notwithstanding
he
has
made
of
one
blood
the
whole
family
of
man
he
has
made
the
whole
family
of
man
to
differ
in
personal
appearance
habits
and
pursuits
i
protest
against
sending
any
to
africa
in
whose
blood
there
is
any
mixture
of
our
own
for
i
repeat
it
white
blood
in
africa
would
be
as
repugnant
to
nature
as
black
blood
is
in
this
country
now
most
unfortunately
for
colonizationists
the
spirit
of
amalgamation
has
been
so
active
for
a
long
series
of
years
especially
in
the
slave
states
that
there
are
comparatively
few
besides
those
who
are
annually
smuggled
into
the
south
from
africa
whose
blood
is
not
tainted
with
a
foreign
ingredient
here
then
is
a
difficulty
what
shall
be
done
all
black
blood
be
sent
to
africa
but
how
to
collect
it
is
the
question
what
shall
be
done
why
we
must
resort
to
prepare
thee
to
cut
off
the
flesh
nor
cut
thou
less
nor
more
but
just
a
pound
of
flesh
if
thou
more
or
less
than
just
a
pound
be
it
but
so
much
as
makes
it
light
or
heavy
in
the
substance
or
the
division
of
the
twentieth
part
of
one
poor
scruple
nay
if
the
scale
do
turn
but
in
the
estimation
of
a
hair
thou
diest
and
all
thy
goods
are
confiscate
the
colonization
crusade
can
not
now
fail
of
being
popular
phlebotomy
being
agreed
to
as
a
i
shall
briefly
enumerate
some
of
the
various
professions
and
classes
which
may
expect
to
derive
no
inconsiderable
gain
from
its
execution
for
as
our
government
in
conjunction
with
benevolent
associations
is
to
appropriate
millions
of
dollars
to
accomplish
this
object
the
pay
will
be
sure
and
liberal
in
the
first
place
there
will
be
more
than
a
million
patients
for
whose
accommodation
hospitals
must
be
erected
these
hospitals
will
employ
masons
carpenters
painters
glaziers
of
course
the
approval
of
a
large
body
of
mechanics
is
readily
secured
physicians
will
next
obtain
an
extensive
practice
their
patients
in
consequence
of
a
free
application
of
the
lancet
must
necessarily
be
debilitated
and
can
be
kept
low
until
a
long
score
of
charges
be
run
up
against
the
government
among
so
many
patients
and
so
much
unavoidable
sickness
druggists
and
apothecaries
will
obtain
a
profitable
sale
for
their
medicines
nurses
will
be
next
in
demand
who
may
expect
high
wages
even
the
lowly
washers
of
soiled
clothes
will
find
the
of
the
victims
into
drachms
for
their
reward
it
is
highly
probable
that
many
of
the
patients
may
die
under
the
expurgatory
process
and
hence
sextons
and
may
calculate
upon
good
times
with
death
come
mourning
and
lamentation
and
of
wo
dealers
in
crape
will
doubtless
secure
a
handsome
patronage
lawyers
may
hope
to
profit
by
the
demise
of
those
who
possess
property
indeed
almost
every
class
in
community
must
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
feel
the
beneficial
effects
of
this
philanthropic
but
novel
experiment
the
blood
taken
from
the
veins
of
the
blacks
may
be
transfused
into
our
own
and
the
general
pulse
acquire
new
vigor
supposing
a
majority
of
the
patients
should
recover
three
other
classes
will
thrive
by
their
expulsion
namely
merchants
and
seamen
as
our
vessels
are
all
occupied
in
profitable
pursuits
new
ones
must
be
built
freights
will
rise
and
the
wages
of
seamen
be
proportionably
but
a
truce
to
irony
the
american
colonization
society
in
making
the
banishment
of
the
slaves
the
condition
of
their
emancipation
inflicts
upon
them
an
aggravated
wrong
perpetuates
their
thraldom
and
disregards
the
claims
of
everlasting
and
immutable
justice
the
language
of
its
most
distinguished
supporters
is
with
the
liberty
to
remain
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
is
but
an
act
of
dreamy
madness
without
removal
from
the
country
is
out
of
the
question
emancipation
to
however
small
an
extent
which
permits
the
person
emancipated
to
remain
in
this
country
is
an
evil
can
not
be
emancipated
as
a
people
and
remain
among
us
thus
the
restoration
of
an
inalienable
right
and
an
abandonment
of
robbery
and
oppression
are
made
to
depend
upon
the
practicability
of
transporting
more
than
one
sixth
portion
of
our
whole
population
to
a
far
distant
and
barbarous
land
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
more
cruel
and
scheme
it
exhibits
a
deliberate
and
perverse
disregard
of
every
moral
obligation
and
bids
defiance
to
the
requisitions
of
the
gospel
listen
to
the
avowal
of
mr
mercer
of
virginia
one
of
the
main
pillars
and
most
highly
extolled
supporters
of
the
society
abolition
of
slavery
was
no
object
of
desire
to
him
unless
accompanied
by
colonization
so
far
was
he
from
desiring
it
unaccompanied
by
this
condition
that
would
not
live
in
a
country
where
the
one
took
place
without
the
this
language
may
be
correctly
rendered
thus
desire
to
see
two
millions
of
human
beings
plundered
of
their
rights
and
subjected
to
every
species
of
wrong
and
outrage
if
they
can
not
be
driven
out
of
the
country
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
live
with
them
while
they
are
treated
worse
than
cattle
ignorant
vicious
and
wretched
and
while
they
are
held
under
laws
which
forbid
their
instruction
and
not
only
am
i
willing
thus
to
live
but
i
am
determined
to
practise
the
same
oppression
but
if
they
should
be
emancipated
with
liberty
to
remain
here
and
placed
in
a
situation
favorable
to
their
moral
and
intellectual
improvement
a
situation
in
which
they
could
be
no
longer
bought
and
sold
lacerated
and
manacled
defrauded
and
oppressed
i
would
abandon
my
native
land
and
never
return
to
her
shores
and
this
is
the
language
of
a
and
this
the
moral
principle
of
the
boasted
champion
of
the
american
colonization
society
whose
indignation
does
not
kindle
whose
astonishment
is
not
profound
whose
disgust
is
not
excited
in
view
of
these
sentiments
but
this
is
not
the
acme
of
colonization
insanity
the
assertion
is
made
by
a
highly
respectable
partisan
and
endorsed
by
the
organ
of
the
society
that
would
be
as
humane
to
throw
the
slaves
from
the
decks
in
the
middle
into
the
ocean
to
set
them
free
in
our
and
even
henry
clay
who
is
an
oracle
in
the
cause
has
had
the
boldness
to
declare
that
the
slaves
should
be
held
in
everlasting
servitude
if
they
can
not
be
colonized
in
africa
and
this
sentiment
is
echoed
by
another
who
says
them
only
on
condition
of
their
going
to
africa
or
hayti
i
will
not
even
seem
to
undervalue
the
good
sense
and
quick
perception
of
the
candid
and
intelligent

by
any
farther
endeavors
to
illustrate
the
sacrifice
of

and
inhumanity
of

so
strong
an

no

fail
to
rise

amazement

abhorrence
and
a
determination

assist
in
overthrowing

combination
which
is
based
upon
the
rotten
foundation

expediency
and
violence
the

expressly
denies

happiness
in

this
denial
incontestibly
tends

the
american
colonization
society
is
the
disparager
of
the
free
blacks
the
leaders
in
the
african
colonization
crusade
seem
to
dwell
with
a
malignant
satisfaction
upon
the
poverty
and
degradation
of
the
free
people
of
color
and
are
careful
never
to
let
an
opportunity
pass
without
heaping
their
abuse
and
contempt
upon
them
it
is
a
common
device
of
theirs
to
contrast
the
condition
of
the
slaves
with
that
of
this
class
and
invariably
to
strike
the
balance
heavily
in
favor
of
the
former
in
this
manner
thousands
are
led
to
look
upon
slavery
as
a
benevolent
system
and
to
deprecate
the
manumission
of
its
victims
nothing
but
a
love
of
falsehood
or
an
utter
disregard
of
facts
could
embolden
these
calumniators
to

so
extensively
in

creatures

vicious
and
miserable
than
slaves
can
be
and
that
they
are
thriftless
race
of
vagabonds
whose
footsteps
are
the
sure
precursors
of
indigence
and
crime
and
these
false
and
infamous
charges
are
brought
against
them
by
a
society
which
professes
to
cherish
for
them
the
highest
regard
and
to
be
anxious
to
give
them
respectability
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
truth
is
the
traducers
of
the
free
blacks
have
no
adequate
conception
of
the
amount
of
good
sense
sterling
piety
moral
honesty
virtuous
pride
of
character
and
domestic
enjoyment
which
exists
among
this
class
the
spirited
remarks
of
the
colored
citizens
of
in
their
address
to
the
public
part
ii
in
reference
to
their
calumniators
are
exceedingly
apposite
patrician
principles
prevent
an
intercourse
with
men
in
the
middle
walks
of
life
among
whom
a
large
portion
of
our
people
may
be
classed
we
ask
them
to
visit
the
dwellings
of
the
respectable
part
of
our
people
and
we
are
satisfied
that
they
will
discover
more
civilization
and
refinement
than
will
be
found
among
the
same
number
of
white
families
of
an
equal
standing
a
personal
examination
enables
me
to
say
that
this
challenge
is
neither
presumptuous
nor
boastful
i
confess
i
have
been
most
agreeably
nay
wonderfully
disappointed
in
my
intercourse
with
them
which
is
daily
elevating
them
in
my
estimation
many
of
their
number
i
proudly
rank
among
my
most
familiar
friends
and
correspondents
with
regard
to
the
set
in
boston
crying
out
liberty
every
candid
resident
will
testify
that
this
is
a
libellous
representation
that
our
free
blacks
are
a
quiet
orderly
and
as
far
as
they
can
obtain
employment
industrious
class
of
citizens
and
that
their
improvement
is
rapid
and
constant
every
curious
observer
who
visits
their
houses
of
worship
will
be
surprised
at
the
general
neatness
of
attire
and
propriety
of
manners
of
the
worshippers
ragged
set
forsooth
the
slander
may
be
uttered
in
the
city
of
washington
at
an
anniversary
of
the
american
colonization
society
but
no
man
who
regards
his
character
for
veracity
and
intelligence
publish
it
in
boston
the
effects
of
this
reiterated
abuse
are
eminently
mischievous
it
serves
to
kindle
the
fires
of
persecution
to
strengthen
prejudice
to
drive
its
victims
to
despair
and
to
increase
the
desire
for
their
banishment
your
utmost
powers
of
imagination
says
one
of
the
colonization
advocates
you
can
not
conceive
to
honorable
effort
which
can
animate
the
bosom
or
give
impulse
to
the
conduct
of
the
free
black
in
this
country
is
this
language
calculated
to
allay
animosity
or
beget
confidence
or
suppress
contempt
or
heal
division
or
excite
sympathy
far
otherwise
are
there
not
thousands
of
living
witnesses
to
prove
the
falsity
of
this
assertion
thousands
who
adorn
the
doctrine
of
god
their
saviour
and
whose
to
honorable
effort
are
higher
than
heaven
and
vast
as
eternity
thousands
who
though
their
enemies
spare
no
efforts
to
crush
them
in
the
dust
and
in
despite
of
mountains
of
difficulties
rise
up
with
a
giant
strength
to
respectability
and
usefulness
motive
to
honorable
effort
perish
the
calumny
again
they
are
stigmatized
as
the
stirrers
up
of
sedition
and
insurrection
this
charge
is
even
more
malignant
than
the
other
and
utterly
groundless
its
propagation
however
tends
directly
to
excite
a
persecution
which
may
drive
the
accused
to
sedition
in
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
free
man
of
color
was
enlisted
in
the
late
bloody
struggle
in
virginia
or
in
any
manner
accessary
thereto
on
the
contrary
it
was
deprecated
by
our
colored
citizens
generally
not
only
on
account
of
its
sanguinary
acts
but
because
they
knew
it
would
operate
to
their
own
disadvantage
by
being
placed
to
their
account
the
following
honorable
expression
of
feeling
was
made
at
a
public
meeting
of
the
people
of
color
in
wilmington
delaware
about
that
period
subscribers
having
a
knowledge
of
the
alarm
which
prevails
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
citizens
of
this
place
on
account
of
various
reports
which
some
mischievous
person
or
persons
have
circulated
in
regard
to
the
colored
population
beg
leave
to
represent
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
brethren
that
having
made
inquiry
into
the
subject
they
have
found
said
reports
to
be
without
the
least
foundation
and
they
owe
it
to
themselves
further
to
declare
that
so
far
from
any
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
colored
people
to
disturb
the
peace
and
good
order
of
the
community
they
are
on
the
contrary
fully
aware
that
it
consists
not
less
with
their
interests
than
their
duty
to
refrain
from
every
art
that
would
excite
commotion
or
disorder
in
which
the
colored
people
would
have
every
thing
to
lose
and
nothing
to
gain
we
have
been
treated
by
the
citizens
of
wilmington
and
its
vicinity
with
kindness
for
which
we
ought
to
be
grateful
and
it
is
our
solemn
purpose
to
pursue
such
a
course
of
conduct
as
may
merit
a
continuance
of
their
favor
and
confidence
should
any
among
us
be
found
so
wicked
and
blinded
as
to
enter
into
plots
and
contrivances
inimical
to
the
present
harmony
we
thus
solemnly
pledge
ourselves
to
our
white
friends
and
neighbors
that
we
will
be
among
the
first
to
sound
the
alarm
and
unite
in
effecting
their
apprehension
and
suppression
the
free
colored
citizens
of
baltimore
maryland
also
came
out
unitedly
in
the
following
pacific
and
truly
exemplary
spirit
there
has
prevailed
in
this
city
during
the
past
week
a
very
unpleasant
excitement
originating
from
suspicions
and
reports
totally
without
foundation
and
highly
derogatory
to
our
good
sense
and
whereas
this
excitement
though
unnecessarily
created
may
in
its
ultimate
tendency
prove
prejudicial
to
the
interests
of
the
free
colored
population
of
this
state
therefore
that
we
challenge
the
most
rigid
investigation
as
to
the
truth
of
those
evil
reports
which
have
recently
been
so
industriously
propagated
in
this
city
by
the
credulous
and
those
who
are
totally
unacquainted
with
the
character
of
colored
baltimoreans
that
we
are
not
so
reckless
of
our
true
interest
so
blind
to
utter
helplessness
not
to
say
so
devoid
of
humanity
as
to
entertain
the
hostile
designs
or
to
cherish
the
fiendish
passions
which
it
seems
have
been
by
the
unthinking
so
unjustly
attributed
to
us
that
we
have
been
too
long
in
the
land
of
bibles
and
temples
and
ministers
to
look
upon
blood
and
carnage
with
complacency
that
we
have
been
too
long
in
this
enlightened
metropolis
to
think
of
the
amelioration
of
our
condition
in
any
other
way
than
that
sanctioned
by
the
gospel
of
peace
that
we
rely
upon
a
peaceable
and
upright
conduct
for
a
continuance
of
that
favor
and
protection
which
we
have
hitherto
enjoyed
and
which
the
liberal
the
wise
and
the
good
are
ever
ready
to
accord
how
impolitic
then
as
well
as
unjust
to
brand
this
meek
and
magnanimous
class
as
wild
stirrers
up
of
sedition
and
insurrection
this
treatment
i
repeat
is
impolitic
nay
suicidal
to
abuse
proscribe
and
exasperate
them
to
trample
them
under
our
feet
to
goad
them
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
is
not
the
way
to
secure
their
loyalty
but
rather
to
make
them
revengeful
desperate
and
seditious
our
true
policy
is
to
meliorate
their
condition
invigorate
their
hopes
instruct
their
ignorant
minds
admit
them
to
an
equality
of
privileges
with
ourselves
nourish
and
patronise
their
genius
and
by
giving
them
mechanical
trades
and
mercantile
advantages
open
to
them
the
avenue
to
competence
and
wealth
we
shall
thus
make
them
contented
and
happy
and
place
them
in
a
situation
which
will
lead
them
still
more
heartily
to
deprecate
any
insurrectionary
movements
among
our
slave
population
the
following
is
the
conciliatory
and
generous
language
of
a
man
who
has
been
denounced
as
a
and
a
monster
it
will
be
well
for
us
if
we
profit
by
it
notwithstanding
you
have
and
do
continue
to
treat
us
more
cruel
than
any
heathen
nation
ever
did
a
people
it
had
subjected
to
the
same
condition
that
you
have
us
let
us
reason
had
you
not
better
take
our
body
while
you
have
it
in
your
power
and
while
we
are
yet
ignorant
and
wretched
not
knowing
but
little
give
us
education
and
teach
us
the
pure
religion
of
our
lord
and
master
which
is
calculated
to
make
the
lion
lie
down
in
peace
with
the
lamb
and
which
millions
of
you
have
beaten
us
nearly
to
death
for
trying
to
obtain
since
we
have
been
among
you
and
thus
at
once
gain
our
affection
while
we
are
ignorant
throw
away
your
fears
and
prejudices
then
and
enlighten
us
and
treat
us
like
men
and
we
will
like
you
more
than
we
do
now
hate
you
and
tell
us
now
no
more
about
colonization
for
america
is
as
much
our
country
as
it
is
yours
treat
us
like
men
and
there
is
no
danger
but
we
will
all
live
in
peace
and
happiness
together
for
we
are
not
like
you
unmerciful
and
unforgiving
what
a
happy
country
this
will
be
if
the
whites
will
listen
what
nation
under
heaven
will
be
able
to
do
any
thing
with
us
unless
god
gives
us
up
into
its
hand
but
americans
i
declare
to
you
while
you
keep
us
and
our
children
in
bondage
and
treat
us
like
brutes
to
make
us
support
you
and
your
families
we
can
not
be
your
friends
you
do
not
look
for
it
do
you
treat
us
then
like
men
and
we
will
be
your
friends
and
there
is
not
a
doubt
in
my
mind
but
that
the
whole
of
the
past
will
be
sunk
into
oblivion
and
we
yet
under
god
will
become
a
united
and
happy
people
v
footnotes
s
a
cruel
taunt
the
wonder
is
not
that
colored
persons
do
not
more
generally
visit
our
sanctuaries
but
that
they
should
attend
if
they
go
they
are
thrust
into
obscure
remote
and
unseemly
pens
or
boxes
as
if
they
were
not
embraced
in
the
offers
of
redeeming
love
and
were
indeed
a
part
of
the
brute
creation
it
is
an
awful
commentary
upon
the
pride
of
human
nature
i
never
can
look
up
to
these
scandalous
retreats
for
my
colored
brethren
without
having
my
soul
overwhelmed
with
emotions
of
shame
indignation
and
sorrow
no
black
man
however
virtuous
respectable
or
pious
he
may
be
can
own
or
occupy
a
pew
in
a
central
part
of
any
of
our
houses
of
worship
and
yet
it
is
reproachfully
alleged
by
a
clergyman
too
that
we
visit
the
sanctuaries
which
are
to
to
worship
and
to
hear
the
word
of
god
we
shall
not
find
them
there
no
i
hope
they
will
respect
themselves
and
the
religion
of
jesus
more
than
to
occupy
the
places
alluded
to
t
francis
devany
the
colored
sheriff
of
liberia
is
reputed
by
colonizationists
to
be
worth
property
to
the
value
of
thousand
dollars
and
they
have
trumpeted
the
fact
all
over
the
country
and
so
repeatedly
as
almost
to
lead
one
to
imagine
that
he
is
the
greatest
and
wealthiest
man
in
all
the
world
james
forten
the
reputable
colored
of
philadelphia
a
gentleman
of
highly
polished
manners
and
superior
intelligence
with
whom
devany
worked
as
a
journeyman
can
him
three
or
four
times
over
joseph

another
estimable
and
intelligent
man
of

or
the

of

both
of

can
purchase
him
i
mention
their
names
not
to
extol
them
but
simply
to
show
that
what
begets
fame
in
liberia
is
unproductive
here
u
the
following
statement
recently
published
in
the
philadelphia
and
advocate
of
truth
is
very
creditable
to
the
colored
inhabitants
of
that
city
erroneous
opinions
have
prevailed
with
regard
to
the
true
character
and
condition
of
the
free
colored
people
of
pennsylvania
they
have
been
represented
as
an
idle
and
worthless
class
furnishing
inmates
for
our
and
penitentiaries
a
few
plain
facts
are
sufficient
to
refute
these
gratuitous
allegations
in
the
city
and
suburbs
of
philadelphia
by
the
census
of
they
constituted
about
eleven
per
or
one
ninth
of
the
whole
population
from
the
account
of
the
guardians
of
the
poor
printed
by
order
of
the
board
it
appears
that
of
the
poor
receiving
regular
weekly
supplies
in
the
first
month
the
time
of
the
greatest
need
the
people
of
color
were
about
one
to
whites
or
not
quite
four
per
a
disproportion
of
whites
to
colored
of
more
than
two
to
one
in
favor
of
the
latter
when
it
is
considered
that
they
perform
the
lowest
offices
in
the
community
that
the
avenues
to
what
are
esteemed
the
most
honorable
and
profitable
professions
in
society
are
in
a
great
measure
if
not
wholly
closed
against
them
these
facts
are
the
more
creditable
to
them
one
cause
of
this
disproportion
which
we
presume
is
but
little
known
but
which
is
worthy
of
special
notice
will
be
found
in
the
numerous
societies
among
themselves
for
mutual
aid
these
societies
expended
in
one
year
about
six
thousand
dollars
for
the
relief
of
the
sick
and
the
indigent
of
their
own
color
from
funds
raised
among
themselves
besides
the
taxes
paid
by
the
colored
people
of
philadelphia
exceed
in
amount
the
sums
expended
out
of
the
funds
of
the
city
for
the
relief
of
their
poor
it
is
also
a
fact
that
the
proportion
of
whites
in
the
in
is
greater
than
that
of
the
blacks
i
am
aware
that
other
evidence
of
a
different
kind
may
be
adduced
in
other
places
but
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
unfair
to
measure
the
whole
body
of
blacks
by
the
whole
body
of
whites
for
the
privileges
and
advantages
of
the
whites
are
as
ten
thousand
to
one
they
monopolise
almost
every
branch
of
business
and
every
pursuit
of
life
they
have
all
the
means
necessary
to
make
men
virtuous
intelligent
active
and
opulent
far
different
is
the
situation
of
the
free
blacks
how
slender
are
their
means
how
mean
and
limited
their
occupations
how
inferior
their
advantages
almost
every
avenue
to
wealth
preferment
and
usefulness
is
closed
against
them
how
are
they
persecuted
how
avoided
in
the
streets
how
excluded
from
the
benefits
of
society
to
point
at
them
the
finger
of
scorn
to
taunt
them
for
their
inferiority
or
helplessness
is
like
putting
out
the
eyes
and
clipping
the
wings
of
the
eagle
and
then
reproaching
him
because
he
can
neither
see
nor
fly
to
boast
of
our
superior
refinement
intelligence
and
virtue
is
the
extreme
of
vainglory

adding

power
enough
in

to
melt
down
the
most
stubborn
prejudices
to
overthrow
the
highest

these

could

depart
unguardedly

hope
from

love

integrity
as
to
utter
this
language
in
an
address
in
behalf
of
the
colonization
society
us
they
the
free
people
of
color
have
been
degraded
by
slavery
and
further
degraded
by
the
mockery
of
nominal
were
this
true
it
would
imply
that
we
of
the
free
states
are
more
barbarous
and
neglectful
than
even
the
traffickers
in
souls
and
at
the
south
we
have
not
it
is
certain
treated
our
colored
brethren
as
the
law
of
kindness
and
the
ties
of
brotherhood
demand
but
have
we
outdone
slaveholders
in
cruelty
were
it
true
to
forge
new
fetters
for
the
limbs
of
these
degraded
beings
would
be
an
act
of
benevolence
but
their
condition
is
as
much
superior
to
that
of
the
slaves
as
happiness
is
to
misery
the
second
portion
of
this
work
containing
their
proceedings
in
a
collective
capacity
shows
whether
they
have
made
any
progress
in
intelligence
in
virtue
in
piety
and
in
happiness
since
their
liberation
again
he
says
have
but
endeavored
in
vain
restore
them
either
to
or
to
the
respect
of
it
is
painful
to
contradict
so
worthy
an
individual
but
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
this
statement
is
altogether
erroneous
we
have
derided
we
have
shunned
we
have
neglected
them
in
every
possible
manner
they
have
had
to
rise
not
only
under
the
mountainous
weight
of
their
own
ignorance
and
vice
but
with
the
additional
and
constant
pressure
of
our
contempt
and
injustice
in
despite
of
us
they
have
done
well
again
is
not
our
fault
that
we
have
it
is
not
theirs
we
wholly
and
exclusively
in
fault
what
have
we
done
to
raise
them
up
from
the
earth
what
have
we
done
to
keep
them
down
once
more
has
resulted
from
a
cause
over
which
neither
they
nor
we
can
ever
have
control
in
other
words
they
have
been
made
with
skins
not
colored
like
our
own
and
we
can
not
recognise
them
as
or
treat
them
like
rational
beings
one
sixth
of
our
whole
population
for
ever
in
this
land
remain
a
wretched
ignorant
and
degraded
race
and
yet
nobody
be
culpable
but
the
who
has
made
us
of
doing
unto
others
as
we
would
have
them
do
unto
us
horrible
horrible
if
this
be
not
an
impeachment
of
infinite
goodness
i
do
not
say
intentionally
but
i
can
not
define
it
the
same
sentiment
is
reiterated
by
a
writer
in
the
southern
religious
telegraph
who
says
exclusion
of
the
free
black
from
the
civil
and
literary
privileges
of
our
country
depends
on
another
circumstance
than
that
of
character
a
circumstance
which
as
it
was
entirely
beyond
his
control
so
it
is
unchangeable
and
will
for
ever
operate
this
circumstance
is
is
a
black
and
the
board
of
managers
of
the
parent
society
in
their
fifteenth
annual
report
declare
that
ordination
of
prevents
the
general
improvement
of
the
people
of
color
in
this
land
how
are
god
and
our
country
dishonored
and
the
requirements
of
the
gospel
contemned
by
this
ungodly
plea
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
creator
is
alone
blameable
for
the
past
and
present
degradation
of
the
free
blacks
nott
draws
the
natural
and
unavoidable
inference
that
therefore
they
must
be
ever
debased
for
ever
useless
for
ever
a
nuisance
for
ever
a
and
then
gravely
declares
mark
the
climax
yet
they
these
ignorant
helpless
miserable
creatures
and
they
only
are
qualified
for
colonizing
africa
then
he
asks
the
name
of
the
abrupt
appeal
in
this
connexion
seems
almost
profane
we
hesitate
to
encourage
their
departure
nature
we
are
positively
assured
has
raised
up
impassable
barriers
between
the
races
i
understand
by
this
expression
that
the
blacks
are
of
a
different
species
from
ourselves
so
that
all
attempts
to
generate
offspring
between
us
and
them
must
prove
as
abortive
as
between
a
man
and
a
beast
it
is
a
law
of
nature
that
the
lion
shall
not
beget
the
lamb
or
the
leopard
the
bear
now
the
planters
at
the
south
have
clearly
demonstrated
that
an
amalgamation
with
their
slaves
is
not
only
possible
but
a
matter
of
course
and
eminently
productive
it
neither
ends
in
abortion
nor
produces
monsters
in
truth
it
is
often
so
difficult
in
the
slave
states
to
distinguish
between
the
fruits
of
this
intercourse
and
the
children
of
white
parents
that
witnesses
are
summoned
at
court
to
solve
the
problem
talk
of
the
barriers
of
nature
when
the
land
swarms
with
living
refutations
of
the
statement
happy
indeed
would
it
be
for
many
a
female
slave
if
such
a
barrier
could
exist
during
the
period
of
her
servitude
to
protect
her
from
the
lust
of
her
master
in
france
w
england
x
spain
and
other
countries
persons
of
color
maintain
as
high
a
rank
and
are
treated
as
honorably
as
any
other
class
of
the
inhabitants
in
despite
of
the
barriers
of
nature
yet
it
is
proclaimed
to
the
world
by
the
colonization
society
that
the
american
people
can
never
be
as
republican
in
their
feelings
and
practices
as
frenchmen
spaniards
or
englishmen
nay
that
itself
can
not
subdue
their
malignant
prejudices
or
induce
them
to
treat
their
brethren
in
accordance
with
their
professions
of
republicanism
my
countrymen
is
it
so
are
you
willing
thus
to
be
held
up
as
tyrants
and
hypocrites
for
ever
as
less
magnanimous
and
just
than
the
populace
of
europe
no
no
i
can
not
give
you
up
as
incorrigibly
wicked
nor
my
country
as
sealed
over
to
destruction
my
confidence
remains
like
the
oak
like
the
alps
unshaken
i
am
not
discouraged
i
am
not
distrustful
i
still
place
an
unwavering
reliance
upon
the
omnipotence
of
truth
i
still
believe
that
the
demands
of
justice
will
be
satisfied
that
the
voice
of
bleeding
humanity
will
melt
the
most
obdurate
hearts
and
that
the
land
will
be
redeemed
and
regenerated
by
an
enlightened
and
energetic
public
opinion
as
long
as
there
remains
among
us
a
single
copy
of
the
declaration
of
independence
or
of
the
new
testament
i
will
not
despair
of
the
social
and
political
elevation
of
my
sable
countrymen
already
a
is
heard
from
the
east
and
the

from

towns
and
cities
and

in
commotion
volunteers
are
trooping
to

the

and
the
fiend
of

are
in
mortal
conflict
and
all
neutrality
is
at
an
end
already
the
line
of

is
drawn
on

are
the

who
can
doubt
the
issue
of
this
controversy
or
which
side
has
the
approbation
of
the
lord
of
hosts
in
the
african
repository
for
september
there
is
an
elaborate
defence
of
the
colonization
society
in
which
occurs
the
following
passage
has
been
said
that
the
society
is
unfriendly
to
the
improvement
of
the
free
people
of
color
while
they
remain
in
the
united
states
charge
is
not
i
reiterate
the
charge
and
the
evidence
of
its
correctness
is
before
the
reader
the
society
prevents
the
education
of
this
class
in
the
most
insidious
and
effectual
manner
by
constantly
asserting
that
they
must
always
be
a
degraded
people
in
this
country
and
that
the
cultivation
of
their
minds
will
avail
them
nothing
who
does
not
readily
perceive
that
the
prevalence
of
this
opinion
must
at
once
paralyze
every
effort
for
their
improvement
for
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
and
means
and
unpardonable
folly
for
us
to
attempt
the
accomplishment
of
an
impossible
work
of
that
which
we
know
will
result
in
disappointment
every
discriminating
and
candid
mind
must
see
and
acknowledge
that
to
perpetuate
their
ignorance
it
is
only
necessary
to
make
the
belief
prevalent
that
they
be
for
ever
debased
for
ever
useless
for
ever
an
inferior
race
and
their
thraldom
is
sure
i
am
aware
that
a
school
has
been
established
for
the
education
of
colored
youth
under
the
auspices
of
the
society
but
it
is
sufficient
to
state
that
none
but
those
who
consent
to
emigrate
to
liberia
are
embraced
in
its
provisions
in
the
appendix
to
the
seventh
annual
report
the
position
is
assumed
that
is
a
well
established
point
that
the
public
safety
forbids
either
the
emancipation
or
of
the
slaves
the
recent
enactment
of
laws
in
some
of
the
slave
states
prohibiting
the
instruction
of
free
colored
persons
as
well
as
slaves
has
received
something
more
than
a
tacit
approval
from
the
organ
of
the
society
a
prominent
advocate
of
the
society
disosway
in
an
oration
on
the
fourth
of
july
alluding
to
these
laws
says
public
safety
of
our
brethren
at
the
south
requires
them
the
slaves
to
be
kept
ignorant
and
uninstructed

is
a

scheme
remarking
upon
the
instruction
of
the
colored
population
of
virginia
says
a
servant
to
read
is
not
teaching
him
the
religion
of
christ
the
great
majority
of
the
white
people
of
our
country
are
taught
to
read
but
probably
not
one
in
five
of
those
who
have
the
bible
is
in
the
legitimate
sense
of
the
term
if
black
people
are
as
depraved
and
as
averse
to
true
religion
as
the
white
people
are
and
we
know
of
no
difference
between
them
in
this
respect
teaching
them
to
read
the
bible
will
make
christians
of
few
of
them
what
a
plea
if
christian
masters
were
to
teach
their
servants
to
read
we
apprehend
that
they
would
not
feel
the
obligation
as
they
ought
to
feel
it
of
giving
them
oral
instruction
and
often
impressing
divine
truth
on
their
minds
if
the
free
colored
people
were
generally
taught
to
read
might
be
an
inducement
to
them
to
remain
in
this
we
would
offer
them
no
such
inducement
a
knowledge
of
letters
and
of
all
the
arts
and
sciences
can
not
counteract
the
influences
under
which
the
character
of
the
negro
be
formed
in
this
country
it
appears
to
us
that
a
greater
benefit
may
be
conferred
on
the
free
colored
people
by
planting
good
schools
for
them
in
africa
and
encouraging
them
to
remove
there
than
by
giving
them
the
knowledge
of
letters
to
make
them
contented
in
their
present
condition

never
more

never
more

the
gospel
of

and

preached
by

holds
that
ignorance
is
the
mother
of

who
would
sequestrate

from
the

of

and

in

to

benighted

and
at
the
same
time
deny

and

the
proposition
which
was
made
last
year
to
erect
a
college
for
the
education
of
colored
youth
in
it
is
well
known
created
an
extraordinary
and
most
disgraceful
tumult
in
that
place
the
of
african
colonization
and
was
generally
scouted
by
the
friends
of
the
society
in
other
places
the
american
spectator
at
washington
next
to
the
african
repository
the
of
the

used
the
following
language
in
relation
to
the
violent
proceedings
of
the
citizens
of
not
only
the
which
they
have
pursued
but
we
the
moral
which
induced
them
the
love
of
to
incur
the
censure
of
both
sections
of
the
country
as
a
farther
illustration
of
the
complacency
with
which
colonizationists
regard
the
laws
prohibiting
the
instruction
of
the
blacks
i
extract
the
following
paragraph
from
the
of
the
state
colonization
society
on
its
second
anniversary
is
the
business
of
the
free
safety
requires
to
keep
the
slaves
in
ignorance
their
education
is
utterly
prohibited
educate
them
and
they
break
their
fetters
suppose
the
slaves
of
the
south
to
have
the
knowledge
of
freemen
they
would
be
free
or
be
exterminated
by
the
whites
this
renders
it
necessary
to
prevent
their
instruction
to
keep
them
from
sunday
schools
and
other
means
of
gaining
knowledge
but
a
few
days
ago
a
proposition
was
made
in
the
legislature
of
georgia
to
allow
them
so
much
instruction
as
to
enable
them
to
read
the
bible
which
was
promptly
rejected
by
a
large
majority
i
do
not
mention
this
for
the
purpose
of
the
of
the
slaveholding
states
but
to
lament
its
elias
caldwell
one
of
the
founders
and
the
first
secretary
of
the
parent
society
in
a
speech
delivered
at
its
formation
advanced
the
following
monstrous
sentiments
more
you
improve
the
condition
of
these
people
the
more
you
cultivate
their
minds
the
more
you
make
them
in
their
present
state
you
give
them
a
higher
relish
for
those
privileges
they
can
never
and
turn
what
you
intend
for
a
blessing
into
a
curse
no
if
they
must
remain
in
their
present
situation
them
in
the
lowest
state
of
ignorance
and
the
nearer
you
bring
them
to
the
condition
of
the
better
chance
do
you
give
them
of
possessing
their
apathy
so
then
the
american
colonization
society
advocates
and
to
a
great
extent
perpetuates
the
ignorance
and
degradation
of
the
colored
population
of
the
united
states
in
a
critical
examination
of
the
pages
of
the
african
repository
and
of
the
reports
and
addresses
of
the
parent
society
and
its
auxiliaries
i
can
not
find
in
a
single
instance
any
impeachment
of
the
conduct
and
feelings
of
society
toward
the
people
of
color
or
any
hint
that
the
prejudice
which
is
so
prevalent
against
them
is
unmanly
and
sinful
or
any
evidence
of
contrition
for
past
injustice
or
any
remonstrance
or
entreaty
with
a
view
to
a
change
of
public
sentiment
or
any
symptoms
of
moral
indignation
at
such
unchristian
and
treatment
on
the
contrary
i
find
the
doctrine
every
where
inculcated
that
this
hatred
and
contempt
this
abuse
and
proscription
are
not
only
excusable
but
the
natural
inevitable
and
incurable
effects
of
constitutional
dissimilitude
growing
out
of
an
ordination
of
providence
for
which
there
is
no
remedy
but
a
separation
between
the
two
races
if
the
free
blacks
then
have
been
further
degraded
by
the
mockery
of
nominal
freedom
if
they
always
be
a
separate
and
degraded
race
if
must
and
will
press
them
to
the
earth
if
from
their
present
station
can
never
rise
be
their
talents
their
enterprise
their
virtues
what
they
may
if
africa
alone
they
can
enjoy
the
motives
for
honorable
ambition
the
american
colonization
society
is
responsible
for
their
debasement
and
misery
for
as
it
numbers
among
its
supporters
the
most
influential
men
in
our
country
and
boasts
of
having
the
approbation
of
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
wise

examples
are

is
able
were
it
willing
to
effect
a
radical
change
in
public
sentiment
nay
it
is
at
the
present
time
public
sentiment
itself
but
though
it
has
done
much
and
may
do
more
all
that
it
can
it
will
do
to
depress
impoverish

dispirit
the
free
people

and
to
strengthen

influence
mutual
antipathies
it
is
the
purpose
of
god
i
am
fully
persuaded
to
humble
the
pride
of
the
american
people
by
rendering
the
expulsion
of
our
colored
countrymen
utterly
impracticable
and
the
necessity
for
their
admission
to
equal
rights
imperative
as
neither
mountains
of
prejudice
nor
the
massy
shackles
of
law
and
of
public
opinion
have
been
able
to
keep
them
down
to
a
level
with
slaves
i
confidently
anticipate
their
exaltation
among
ourselves
through
the
vista
of
time
a
short
distance
only
i
see
them
here
not
in
africa
not
bowed
to
the
earth
or
derided
and
persecuted
as
at
present
not
with
a
downcast
air
or
an
irresolute
step
but
standing
erect
as
men
destined
heavenward
unembarrassed
untrammelled
with
none
to
molest
or
make
them
afraid
footnotes
v

appeal
w
why
is
it
that
the
free
people
of
color
are
now
in
almost
every
part
of
our
country
threatened
with
banishment
from

until
there

it

an
inferior

their

wherever

of

and
equality

proclaim
the
contrary
the
true
cause
of
this
almost
universal
prescription
is
to
be
found
in
the
melancholy
fact
that
we
have
been
guilty
of
the
most
atrocious
injustice
to
their
forefathers
and
to
themselves
we
would
therefore
now
banish

open

when
a

stranger
enters

church
and
at
hotels
nobody
thinks
it
a
degradation
to
have
a
colored
traveller
sit
at
the
same
table
we
have
heard
a
well
authenticated
anecdote
which
illustrates
the
different
state
of
feeling
in
the
two
countries
on
this
subject
a
wealthy
american
citizen
was
residing
at
london
for
a
season
which
time
the
famous
mr
prince
saunders
was
there
the
london
breakfast
hour
is
very
late
and
prince
saunders
happened
to
call
upon
the
american
while
his
family
were
taking
their
morning
repast
politeness
and
native
good
feelings
prompted
the
lady
to
ask
her
guest
to
take
a
cup
of
coffee
but
then
the
of
how
could
she
overcome
true
he
was
a
gentleman
in
character
manners
and
dress
but
he
had
a
black
skin
and
how
could
white
skins
sit
at
the
same
table
with
him
if
his
had
been
as
black
as
perdition
the
difficulty
might
have
been
overcome
however
reluctantly
but
his
being
black
it
was
altogether
out
of
the
question
so
the
lady
sipped
her
coffee
and
prince
saunders
sat
at
the
window
occasionally
speaking
in
reply
to
conversation
addressed
to
him
at
last
all
retired
from
the
breakfast
table
and
then
the
lady
with
an
air
of
sudden
recollection
said
forgot
to
ask
if
you
had
breakfasted
mr
saunders
wo
you
let
me
give
you
a
cup
of
coffee
thank
you
madam
he
replied
with
a
dignified
bow
am
engaged
to
breakfast
with
the
prince
regent
this
morning
we
laugh
at
the
narrow
bigotry
of
the
mahometan
who
feels
contaminated
if
a
christian
shares
his
dinner
and
who
will
not
give
his
vile
carcass
burial
for
fear
of
pollution
is
our
prejudice
against
persons
of
color
more
rational
or
more
just
the
plain
fact
is
our
prejudice
has
the
same
foundation
as
that
of
the
mahometan
both
are
grounded
in
pride
and
selfishness
a
law
has

and

the

it
is
now
about
fifteen
years
since
the
american
colonization
society
sprang
into
existence
a
space
of
time
amply
sufficient
to
test
its
ability
in
its
behalf
the
pulpit
and
the
press
two
formidable
engines
have
been
exerted
to
an
extraordinary
degree
statesmen
and
orators
and
judges
and
lawyers
and
philanthropists
have
eloquently
advocated
its
claims
to
public
patronage
during
this
protracted
period
and
with
such
powerful
auxiliaries
a
careless
observer
might
naturally
suppose
that
much
must
have
been
accomplished
towards
abolishing
slavery
but
what
is
the
fact
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
souls
have
been
removed
annually
to
africa
in
all
about
two
thousand
souls
in
fifteen
years
a

from
the
atlantic
ocean
a

of

from
the
american

in
the

the
increase
of

has
amounted

upwards

every

more

are
added

one

fifty

more

have
been
added

following
eloquent
and
comprehensive
circular
published
last
year
in

consequence
of
the
visit
of
elliott
cresson
an
agent
who
was
sent
out
to
dupe
the
philanthropists
of
england
exhibits
the
inefficiency
and
criminality
of
the
society
in
a
striking
light
colonization
society
this
society
was
formed
in
the
united
states
in
its
thirteenth
annual
report

just

country

object
as
expressed

to
promote
and
execute
a
plan
for
colonizing
the
free
people
of
color
residing
in
united
states
in
africa
or
such
other
place
as
congress
shall
deem
most
expedient
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these
that
the
united
states
have
about
enslaved
blacks
that
they
have
about
free
blacks
that
both
these
classes
are
rapidly
increasing
that
both
are
exceedingly
depressed
and
degraded
the
duty
of
the
united
states
to
them
is
the
same
exactly
as
we
owe
to
our
colored
in
our
slave
colonies
viz
to
obey
god
by
letting
them
go
free
by
placing
them
beneath
wise
and
equitable
laws
and
by
loving
them
all
and
treating
them
like
brethren
that
is
to
say
the
unquestionable
duty
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
is
to
emancipate
their
slaves
and
to
raise
the
free
colored
people
to
that
estimation
in
their
native
country
which
is
due
to
them
but
the
american
colonization
society
deliberately
rejects
both
of
these
first
great
duties
and
confines
itself
to
the
colonization
in
africa
of
the
free
colored
people
they
say
in
page
of
their
thirteenth
report
to
abolition
she
could
not
look
and
need
not
look
it
could
do
nothing
in
the
slave
states
for
the
cause
of
humanity
and
in
page
emancipation
with
the
liberty
to
remain
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
is
but
an
act
of
dreamy
madness
now
in
thus
deliberately
letting
the
great
crime
of
negro
slavery
alone
and
in
thus
substituting
a
little
restricted
act
of
very
dubious
benevolence
to
a
few
for
the
great
and
sacred
duty
of
right
which
they
owe
to
all
they
hurt
the
great
cause
of
everlasting
truth
and
love
in
the
following
particulars
by
offering
to
the
nation
a
hope
at
which
many
of
their
best
men
seem
eagerly
grasping
of
getting
rid
of
the
colored
people
abroad
they
conduce
more
and
more
as
this
hope
prevails
to
keep
out
of
mind
the
superior
unalterable
and
immediate
duty
of
righting
them
at
home
by
removing
whatever
number
it
be
from
their
native
country
the
number
which
remains
must
be
diminished
and
the
more
the
number
which
remains
is
diminished
the
more
helpless
will
they
become
the
less
will
be
the
hope
of
their
ever
recovering
their
own
liberty
and
the
more
and
longer
will
they
be
trampled
upon
the
more
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
this
is
equally
true
of
great
britain
substitute
a
duty
difficult
expensive
and
partial
as
it
must
be
and
criminal
as
it
unquestionably
is
for
the
duty
which
they
owe
their
negro
of
putting
them
before
the
law
upon
a
par
with
themselves
the
less
will
they
be
likely
to
feel
their
sin
in
continuing
to
wrong
them
and
the
less
they
feel
their
sin
the
less
likely
will
they
be
to
repent
of
it
and
to
do
their
duty
the
greater
the
number
of
slaves
transported
the
greater
will
be
the
value
of
the
labor
of
those
who
remain
the
more
valuable
their
labor
is
the
greater
will
be
the
temptation
to
them
and
the
more
of
course
they
will
be
oppressed
the
american
colonization
society
directly
supports
the
false
and
cruel
idea
that
the
native
country
of
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
is
not
their
native
country
and
that
they
never
can
be
happy
until
they
either
exile
themselves
or
are
exiled
and
thus
powerfully
conduces
to
extinguish
in
them
all
those
delightful
hopes
and
to
prevent
all
that
glorious
exertion
which
would
make
them
a
blessing
to
their
country
in
this
particular
the
american
colonization
society
takes
up
a
falsehood
as
cruel
to
the
colored
people
as
it
is
disgraceful
to
themselves
dwells
upon
it
as
if
it
were
an
irrefragable
truth
urges
it
as
such
upon
others
and
thus
endeavors
with
all
its
force
to
make
practically
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
stains
in
the
american
character
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
scourges
that
could
possibly
afflict
the
free
colored
people
and
which
in
itself
is
essentially
and
unalterably
false
for
be
the
pertinacity
of
prejudice
what
it
may
in
asserting
that
the
blacks
of
america
never
can
be
amalgamated
in
all
respects
in
equal
brotherhood
with
the
whites
it
will
not
the
less
remain
an
everlasting
truth
that
the
wickedness
which
produced
and
perpetuates
the
assertion
is
the
only
ground
of
the
difficulty
and
that
all
that
is
requisite
to
remove
the
whole
evil
is
the
relenting
in
love
of
the
proud
and
cruel
spirit
which
produced
it
could
the
american
colonization
society
succeed
in
establishing
their
views
on
this
subject
as
being
really
true
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
it
would
only
prove
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
past
repentance
that
they
were
given
over
through
their
obstinacy
in
sin
finally
to
believe
a
lie
to
harden
themselves
and
to
perish
in
their
iniquity
but
they
have
not
succeeded
in
establishing
this
fearful
fact
against
themselves
and
as
long
as
they
continue
capable
of
repentance
it
can
be
true
that
the
proud
and
baneful
prejudices
which
now
so
cruelly
alienate
them
from
their
colored
brethren
may
not
will
not
must
not
yield
to
the
sword
of
the
spirit
to
the
word
of
god
to
the
blessed
weapons
of
truth
and
love
the
american
colonization
society
is
beautiful
and
beneficial
as
far
as
it
supports
the
cause
commenced
at
sierra
leone
by
introducing
into
africa
civilization
commerce
and
genuine
christianity
by
checking
the
african
slave
trade
and
by
serving
in
love
the
emigrants
who
choose
to
pass
to
liberia
but
it
powerfully
tends
to
veil
the
existing
and
outrageous
atrocity
of
negro
slavery
and
it
corroborates
against
the
people
of
color
whether
enslaved
or
free
one
of
the
most
base
groundless
and
cruel
prejudices
that
has
ever
disgraced
the
powerful
or
afflicted
the
weak
the
following
calculations
may
throw
further
light
upon
the
subject
the
united
states
have
about
slaves
and
about
free
colored
people
the
american
colonization
society
has
existed
for
thirteen
years
and
has
exported
yearly
upon
an
average
about
persons
meanwhile
the
natural
yearly
increase
has
been
souls
and
nearly
a
million
have
died
in
slavery
but
it
may
be
said
this
is
only
the
beginning
more
may
be
expected
let
us
see
the
average
price
of
transporting
each
individual
is
calculated
at
dollars
suppose
it
to
be
reduced
to
and
then
as
must
be
exported
yearly
in
order
merely
to
prevent
increase
dollars
would
be
yearly
requisite
simply
for
transportation
where
is
this
vast
sum
to
come
from
or
suppose
it
supplied
still
in
the
mass
of
crime
and
wretchedness
as
it
now
exists
there
would
be
two
millions
of
human
beings
every
years
would
still
be
and
in
slavery
but
perhaps
you
wish
to
extinguish
the
crime
in
thirty
years
then
you
must
begin
by
transporting
at
least
yearly
in
order
to
do
this
you
must
have
an
annual
income
of
upwards
of
dollars
and
if
you
have
not
only
to
transport
but
also
to
purchase
you
would
probably
want
yearly
more
where
are
you
to
get
this
or
suppose
it
got
and
still
one
generation
would
perish
in
their
wretchedness
of
immortal
souls
plundered
by
you
of
the
most
sacred
rights
of
human
nature
of
rights
the
and
everlastingly
however
plundered
would
have
perished
and
gone
to
confront
you
at
the
bar
of
god
and
will
he
not
make
inquisition
for
blood
and
what
will
it
avail
you
to
say
oh
we
satisfied
ourselves
and
traversed
land
and
sea
and
spent
thousands
to
satisfy
others
that
if
we
transported
a
few
hundreds
or
thousands
of
our
oppressed
to
a
distant
country
yearly
with
care
we
might
guiltlessly
leave
the
remaining
hundreds
of
thousands
or
the
millions
in
slavery
and
harmlessly
indulge
the
invincible
repugnance
which
we
felt
to
a
colored
skin
we
really
thought
it
better
to
exile
our
colored
brethren
from
their
native
country
or
to
render
their
lives
in
it
intolerable
by
scorn
should
they
obstinately
persist
in
remaining
in
it
we
really
thought
this
better
than
humbling
ourselves
before
our
brother
and
our
god
and
returning
to
both
with
repenting
and
undissembling
love
is
not
such
language
similar

two
most

they
would
be
careful
to
make

exceed
the

such
a

would
be
directly
patronising
the

bribing

seeing

are

doubtless
the

it

in

what
is

selection
when
it

it

to
be

ac
expense
of

such

from
the

to
the

of

has
been
variously
estimated
by
those
who
compute
it
at
the
lowest
rate
the
mere
expense
of
this
transportation
has
been
estimated
at
per
head
in
this
estimate
however
is
not
comprehended
the
expense
of
transporting
the
persons
destined
for
africa
to
the
port
of
their
departure
from
the
united
states
or
the
necessary
expense
of
sustaining
them
either
there
or
in
africa
for
a
reasonable
time
after
their
first
arrival
all
these
expenses
combined
the
committee
think
they
estimate
very
low
when
they
compute
the
amount
at
per
head
it
has
been
estimated
by
some
at
double
this
amount
and
if
past
experience
may
be
relied
upon
as
proving
any
thing
the
official
documents
formerly
furnished
to
the
senate
by
the
department
of
the
navy
show
that
the
expenses
attending
the
transportation
of
the
few
captured
slaves
who
have
been
returned
to
africa
by
the
united
states
at
the
expense
of
this
government
exceeds
even
the
largest
but
taking
the
expense
to
be
only
what
the
committee
have
estimated
it
then
the
sum
requisite
to
transport
the
whole
number
of
the
free
colored
population
of
the
united
states
would
exceed
millions
of
dollars
and
the
expense
of
transporting
a
number
equal
only
to
the
mere
annual
increase
of
this
population
would
exceed
seven
hundred
thousand
dollars
per
annum
sums
which
would
impose
upon
the
people
of
this
country
an
additional
burthen
of
taxation
greater
than
this
committee
believe
they
could
easily
bear
and
much
greater
than
ought
to
be
imposed
upon
them
for
any
such
purpose
annual
increase
of
the
slave
population
at
present
is
at
least
now
allow
the
same
sum
per
head
for
the
transportation
of
these
persons
that
has
been
estimated
for
the
transportation
in
the
other
similar
case
and
the
sum
requisite
to
defray
the
expense
of
the
transportation
of
all
the
slaves
in
the
united
states
would
be
one
hundred
and
ninety
millions
of
dollars
and
that
requisite
to
defray
the
expense
of
the
transportation
of
a
number
only
equal
to
their
mere
annual
increase
would
be
five
millions
seven
hundred
thousand
dollars
per
annum
but
to
either
of
these
sums
must
be
added
the
reasonable
equivalent
or
necessary
aid
to
be
paid
by
the
united
states
to
humane
individuals
in
order
to
induce
them
voluntarily
to
part
with
their
property
the
committee
have
no
by
which
they
can
measure
what
this
might
be
but
any
sum
however
small
will
make
so
great
an
augmentation
of
the
amount
as
almost
to
baffle
calculation
and
to
exhibit
this
project
at

as
one
exceeding
very
far

even
the

some
who
scarcely

that

the

sacred
right
no

how
great
were
their

privations

enjoyments
they
would
not
have
perilled
their
lives
on
the
stormy
deep
to
obtain
an
asylum
in
this
western
hemisphere
it
may
be
said
in
reply
to
the
foregoing
remarks
upon
the
love
of
home
and
of
country
that
the
people
of
color
can
not
cherish
this
abhorrence
of
migration
because
here
they
have
no
city
and
are
not
recognised
as
in
part
i
have
shown
by
copious
extracts
that
colonizationists
artfully
represent
them
as
aliens
and
foreigners
wanderers
from
africa
destitute
of
that
which
is
the
bond
of
union
seditious
without
alliances
irresponsible
unambitious
cherishing
no
attachment
to
the
soil
feeling
no
interest
in
our
national
prosperity
ready
for
any
adventure
eager
to
absent
themselves
from
the
land
malignant
in
their
feelings
towards
society
incapable
of
local
preference
content
to
remain
in
ignorance
and
degradation
every
such
representation
is
a
libel
as
i
shall
show
in
subsequent
pages
the
language
of
the
people
of
color
is
is
our
country
here
were
we
born
here
will
we
live
and
die
we
know
of
no
other
place
that
we
can
call
our
true
and
appropriate
home
here
are
our
earliest
and
most
pleasant
associations
we
are
freemen
we
are
brethren
we
are
countrymen
and
we
are
not
for
insurrection
but
for
peace
and
equality
this
is
not
the
language
of
sedition
or
alienated
affection

is
robust
and
deathless
like
the
oak

but
strengthen
its
roots
and
confer
victory
upon
it
even
the
soil
on
which
the
unhappy
slave
toils
and
bleeds
is
to
him
consecrated
earth
african
colonization
is
directly
and
irreconcileably
opposed
to
the
wishes
of
our
colored
population
as
a
body
their
desires
ought
to
be
tenderly
regarded
in
all
my
intercourse
with
them
in
various
towns
and
cities
i
have
never
seen
one
of
their
number
who
was
friendly
to
this
scheme
and
i
have
not
been
backward
in
canvassing
their
opinions
on
this
subject
they
are
as
unanimously
opposed
to
a
removal
to
africa
as
the
cherokees
from
the
and
graves
of
their
fathers
it
is
remarkable
too
that
they
are
as
united
in
their
respect
and
esteem
for
the
republic
of
hayti
but
is
their
they
are
resolute
against
every
migratory
plot
and
willing
to
rely
on
the
justice
of
the
nation
for
an
ultimate
restoration
to
all
their
lost
rights
and
privileges
what
is
the
fact
through
the
instrumentality
of
benjamin
lundy
af
the
distinguished
and
veteran
champion
of
emancipation
a
great
highway
has
been
opened
to
the
haytien
republic
over
which
our
colored
population
may
travel
and
at
the
end
of
their
brief
journey
be
the
free
occupants
of
the
soil
and
meet
such
a
reception
as
was
never
yet
given
to
any
sojourners
in
any
country
since
the
departure
of
israel
into
egypt
one
would
think
that
with
such
inducements
and
under
such
circumstances
this
broad
thoroughfare
would
present
a
most
animating
spectacle
that
the
bustle
and
roar
of
a
journeying
multitude
would
fall
upon
the
ear
like
the
strife
of
the
ocean
or
the
distant
thunder
of
the
retiring
storm
and
that
the
song
of
the
oppressor
and
the
oppressed
a
song
of
deliverance
to
each
would
go
up
to
heaven
till
its
echoes
were
seemingly
the
responses
of
angels
and
justified
spirits
but
it
is
not
so
only
here
and
there
a
traveller
is
seen
to
enter
upon
the
road
there
is
no
noise
of
preparation
or
departure
but
a
silence
deeper
than
the
breathlessness
of
midnight
rests
upon
our
land
not
a
shout
of
joy
is
heard
throughout
our
borders
how
shall
we
account
for
this
amazing
apathy
but
on
the
ground
that
our
colored
population
are
unwilling
to
leave
their
native
homes
no
matter
how
strong
soever
are
the
inducements
held
out
to
them
abroad
if
it
be
said
that
they
are
not
compelled
to
emigrate
against
their
wishes
i
answer
it
is
true
that
direct
is
not
applied
but
why
are
they
induced
to
remove
is
it
because
they
instinctively
prefer
africa
to
their
native
country
do
they
actually
the
perils
of
the
sea
the
hostilities
of
a
savage
tribe
the
sickening
influences
of
an
african
climate
or
are
they
not
peremptorily
assured
that
they
never
can
never
enjoy
their
rights
and
privileges
at
home
and
thus
absolutely
compelled
to
leave
all
that
is
dear
behind
and
to
seek
a
shelter
in
a
strange
land
a
land
of
darkness
and
cruelty
of
barbarism
and
wo
the
free
people
of
color
and
even
the
slaves
have
on
numerous
occasions
given
ocular
demonstration
of
their
attachment
to
this
country
large
numbers
of
them
were
distinguished
for
their
patient
endurance
their
ardent
devotion
and
their
valorous
conduct
during
our
revolutionary
struggle
in
the
last
war
they
signalized
themselves
in
a
manner
which
extorted
the
applause
even
of
their
calumniators
of
many
who
are
doubtless
at
the
present
day
representing
them
as
seditious
and
inimical
to
the
prosperity

to
this
famous
proclamation
makes
the
following
brief
comment
we
could
be
of
any
use
to
the
army
we
possessed
all
the
cardinal
virtues
but
now
that
time
has
passed
we
forsooth
are
the
most
miserable
worthless
beings
the
lord
in
his
wise
judgment
ever
sent
to
curse
the
rulers
of
this
troublesome
world
i
feel
an
anathema
rising
from
my
heart
but
i
have
suppressed
it
how
black
is
the
ingratitude
how
pitiful
the
hypocrisy
manifested
in
our
conduct
as
a
people
toward
our
colored
population
every
cheek
should
wear
the
blush
of
shame
every
head
be
bowed
in
from
the
organization
of
the
american
colonization
society
down
to
the
present
time
the
free
people
of
color
have
publicly
and
repeatedly
expressed
their
opposition
to
it
they
indignantly
reject
every
overture
for
their
expatriation
it
has
been
industriously
circulated
by
the
advocates
of
colonization
that
i
have
caused
this
hostility
to
the
african
scheme
in
the
bosoms
of
the
blacks
and
that
until
the
liberator
was
established
they
were
friendly
to
it
this
story
is
founded
upon
sheer
ignorance
it
is
my
solemn
conviction
that
i
have
not
proselyted
a
dozen
individuals
for
the
very
conclusive
reason
that
no
conversions
were
necessary
their
sentiments
were
familiar
to
me
long
before
they
knew
my
own
my
opponents
abundantly
overrate
my
influence
in
acknowledging
that
i
have
overthrown
in
a
single
year
the
concentrated
energies
of
the
mightiest
men
in
the
land
and
the
perpetual
labors
of
fifteen
years
they
shall
not
make
me
vain
such
a
concession
affords
substantial
evidence
of
perverted
strength
and
misapplied
exertion
if
the
people
of
color
were
instantly
to
signify
their
willingness
to
emigrate
my
hostility
to
the
american
colonization
society
would
scarcely
abate
one
jot
for
their
assent
could
never
justify
the
principles
and
doctrines
propagated
by
the
society
those
principles
and
doctrines
have
been
shown
i
trust
to
be
corrupt
selfish
proscriptive
opposed
to
the
genius
of
republicanism
and
to
the
spirit
of
christianity
the
first
public
demonstration
of
hostility
to
the
colonization
scheme
was
made
in
by
the
free
colored
inhabitants
of
richmond
virginia
the
proceedings
of
their
meeting
copies
of
which
were
printed
for

i

accidentally
mislaid
to
the
sentiments

people
of

as
expressed
in
the
following
pages
i
can
not
too
earnestly
solicit
the
serious
attention
of
every
good
man
and
true
philanthropist
after
such
an
exhibition
persistance
in
expelling
this
portion

numerous
meeting
of
the
people
of
color
convened
at
bethel
church
to
take
into
consideration
the
propriety
of
remonstrating
against
the
contemplated
measure
that
is
to
exile
us
from
the
land
of
our
nativity
james
forten
was
called
to
the
chair
and
russell
parrott
appointed
secretary
the
intent
of
the
meeting
having
been
stated
by
the
chairman
the
following
resolutions
were
adopted
without
one
dissenting
voice
whereas
our
ancestors
not
of
choice
were
the
first
successful
cultivators
of
the
wilds
of
america
we
their
descendants
feel
ourselves
entitled
to
participate
in
the
blessings
of
her
luxuriant
soil
which
their
blood
and
sweat
manured
and
that
any
measure
or
system
of
measures
having
a
tendency
to
banish
us
from
her
bosom
would
not
only
be
cruel
but
in
direct
violation
of
those
principles
which
have
been
the
boast
of
this
republic
resolved
that
we
view
with
deep
abhorrence
the
unmerited
stigma
attempted
to
be
cast
upon
the
reputation
of
the
free
people
of
color
by
the
promoters
of
this
measure
they
are
a
dangerous
and
useless
part
of
the
community
when
in
the
state
of
disfranchisement
in
which
they
live
in
the
hour
of
danger
they
ceased
to
remember
their
wrongs
and
rallied
around
the
standard
of
their
country
resolved
that
we
never
will
separate
ourselves
voluntarily
from
the
slave
population
in
this
country
they
are
our
brethren
by
the
ties
of
consanguinity
of
suffering
and
of
wrong
and
we
feel
that
there
is
more
virtue
in
suffering
privations
with
them
than
fancied
advantages
for
a
season
resolved
that
without
arts
without
science
without
a
proper
knowledge
of
government
to
cast
into
the
savage
wilds
of
africa
the
free
people
of
color
seems
to
us
the
circuitous
route
through
which
they
must
return
to
perpetual
bondage
resolved
that
having
the
strongest
confidence
in
the
justice
of
god
and
philanthropy
of
the
free
states
we
cheerfully
submit
our
destinies
to
the
guidance
of
him
who
suffers
not
a
sparrow
to
fall
without
his
special
providence
resolved
that
a
committee
of
eleven
persons
be
appointed
to
open
a
correspondence
with
the
honorable
joseph
hopkinson
member
of
congress
from
this
city
and
likewise
to
inform
him
of
the
sentiments
of
this
meeting
and
that
the
following
named
persons
constitute
the
committee
and
that
they
have
power
to
call
a
general
meeting
when
they
in
their
judgment
may
deem
it
proper

the

assembled
together
under
circumstances
of
deep
interest
to

happiness
and
welfare
humbly
and
respectfully
lay
before
you
this
expression
of
their
feelings
and
apprehensions
relieved
from
the
miseries
of
slavery
many
of
us
by
your
aid
possessing
the
benefits
which
industry
and
integrity
in
this
prosperous
country
assure
to
all
its
inhabitants
enjoying
the
rich
blessings
of
religion
by
opportunities
of
worshipping
the
only
true
god
under
the
light
of
christianity
each
of
us
according
to
his
understanding
and
having
afforded
to
us
and
to
our
children
the
means
of
education
and
improvement
we
have
no
wish
to
separate
from
our
present
homes
for
any
purpose
whatever
contented
with
our
present
situation
and
condition
we
are
not
desirous
of
increasing
their
prosperity
but
by
honest
efforts
and
by
the
use
of
those
opportunities
for
their
improvement
which
the
constitution
and
laws
allow
to
all
it
is
therefore
with
painful
solicitude
and
sorrowing
regret
we
have
seen
a
plan
for
colonizing
the
free
people
of
color
of
the
united
states
on
the
coast
of
africa
brought
forward
under
the
auspices
and
sanction
of
gentlemen
whose
names
give
value
to
all
they
recommend
and
who
certainly
are
among
the
wisest
the
best
and
the
most
benevolent
of
men
in
this
great
nation
if
the
plan
of
colonizing
is
intended
for
our
benefit
and
those
who
now
promote
it
will
never
seek
our
injury
we
humbly
and
respectfully
urge
that
it
is
not
asked
for
by
us
nor
will
it
be
required
by
any
circumstances
in
our
present
or
future
condition
as
long
as
we
shall
be
permitted
to
share
the
protection
of
the
excellent
laws
and
just
government
which
we
now
enjoy
in
common
with
every
individual
of
the
community
we
therefore
a
portion
of
those
who
are
the
objects
of
this
plan
and
among
those
whose
happiness
with
that
of
others
of
our
color
it
is
intended
to
promote
with
humble
and
grateful
acknowledgments
to
those
who
have
devised
it
renounce
and
disclaim
every
connexion
with
it
and
respectfully
but
firmly
declare
our
determination
not
to
participate
in
any
part
of
it
if
this
plan
of
colonization
now
proposed
is
intended
to
provide
a
refuge
and
a
dwelling
for
a
portion
of
our
brethren
who
are
now
held
in
slavery
in
the
south
we
have
other
and
stronger
objections
to
it
and
we
entreat
your
consideration
of
them
the
ultimate
and
final
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
united
states
by
the
operation
of
various
causes
is
under
the
guidance
and
protection
of
a
just
god
progressing
every
year
witnesses
the
release
of
numbers
of
the
victims
of
oppression
and
affords
new
and
safe
assurances
that
the
freedom
of
all
will
be
in
the
end
accomplished
as
they
are
thus
by
degrees
relieved
from
bondage
our
brothers
have
opportunities
for
instruction
and
improvement
and
thus
they
become
in
some
measure
fitted
for
their
liberty
every
year
many
of
us
have
restored
to
us
by
the
gradual
but
certain
march
of
the
cause
of
abolition
parents
from
whom
we
have
been
long
separated
wives
and
children
whom
we
had
left
in
servitude
and
brothers
in
blood
as
well
as
in
early
sufferings
from
whom
we
had
been
long
parted
but
if
the
emancipation
of
our
kindred
shall
when
the
plan
of
colonization
shall
go
into
effect
be
attended
with
transportation
to
a
distant
land
and
shall
be
granted
on
no
other
condition
the
consolation
for
our
past
sufferings
and
of
those
of
our
color
who
are
in
slavery
which
have
hitherto
been
and
under
the
present
situation
of
things
would
continue
to
be
afforded
to
us
and
to
them
will
cease
for
ever
the
cords
which
now
connect
them
with
us
will
be
stretched
by
the
distance
to
which
their
ends
will
be
carried
until
they
break
and
all
the
sources
of
happiness
which
affection
and
connexion
and
blood
bestow
will
be
ours
and
theirs
no
more
nor
do
we
view
the
colonization
of
those
who
may
become
emancipated
by
its
operation
among
our
southern
brethren
as
capable
of
producing
their
happiness
unprepared
by
education
and
a
knowledge
of
the
truths
of
our
blessed
religion
for
their
new
situation
those
who
will
thus
become
colonists
will
themselves
be
surrounded
by
every
suffering
which
can
afflict
the
members
of
the
human
family
without
arts
without
habits
of
industry
and
unaccustomed
to
provide
by
their
own
exertions
and
foresight
for
their
wants
the
colony
will
soon
become
the
abode
of
every
vice
and
the
home
of
every
misery
soon
will
the
light
of
christianity
which
now
dawns
among
that
portion
of
our
species
be
shut
out
by
the
clouds
of
ignorance
and
their
day
of
life
be
closed
without
the
illuminations
of
the
gospel
to
those
of
our
brothers
who
shall
be
left
behind
there
will
be
assured
perpetual
slavery
and
augmented
sufferings
diminished
in
numbers
the
slave
population
of
the
southern
states
which
by
its
magnitude
alarms
its
proprietors
will
be
easily
secured
those
among
their
bondmen
who
feel
that
they
should
be
free
by
rights
which
all
mankind
have
from
god
and
from
nature
and
who
thus
may
become
dangerous
to
the
quiet
of
their
masters
will
be
sent
to
the
colony
and
the
tame
and
submissive
will
be
retained
and
subjected
to
increased
rigor
year
after
year
will
witness
these
means
to
assure
safety
and
submission
among
their
slaves
and
the
southern
masters
will
colonize
only
those
whom
it
may
be
dangerous
to
keep
among
them
the
bondage
of
a
large
portion
of
our
brothers
will
thus
be
rendered
perpetual
should
the
anticipations
of
misery
and
want
among
the
colonists
which
with
great
deference
we
have
submitted
to
your
better
judgment
be
realized
to
emancipate
and
transport
to
africa
will
be
held
forth
by
slaveholders
as
the
worst
and
heaviest
of
punishments
and

will
be
threatened
and
successfully
used
to
enforce
increased
submission
to
their
wishes
and
subjection
to
their
commands
nor

sufferings
and
sorrows
which
must
be
produced

an
exercise
of
the
right

transport
and
colonize

only
of
their
slaves

may

by
the
slaveholders

attention
and
consideration
of

whom
with
all
humility
we
now
address

from
brothers
and
all
the
agonies
which
were
endured
by
our
forefathers
when
they
were
dragged
into
bondage
from
africa
will
be
again
renewed

increased
anguish

opinions

judgment

evening
the
ult
mr
samuel

was
called
to
the
chair
and
mr
philip
bell
appointed
secretary
the
chairman
stated
that
the
object
of
the
meeting
was
to
take
into
consideration
the
proceedings
of
an
association
under
the
title
of
the
colonization
society
an
address
to
the
of
relative
to
that
society
was
read
from
the
commercial
advertiser
of
the
ult
whereupon
the
following
resolutions
were
unanimously
adopted
whereas
a
number
of
gentlemen
in
this
city
of
mistaken
views
with
respect
to
the
wishes
and
welfare
of
the
people
of
this
state
on
the
subject
of
african
colonization
and
in
pursuance
of
such
mistaken
views
are
using
every
exertion
to
form
colonization
societies
and
whereas
a
public
document
purporting
to
be
an
address
to
the
people
of
the
of
on
this
subject
contains
opinions
and
assertions
regarding
the
people
of
color
as
unfounded
as
they
are
unjust
and
derogatory
to
them
therefore
resolved
that
this
meeting
do
most
solemnly
protest
against
the
said
address
as
containing
sentiments
with
respect
to
the
people
of
color
unjust
illiberal
and
unfounded
tending
to
excite
the
prejudice
of
the
community
resolved
that
in
our
opinion
the
sentiments
put
forth
in
the
resolution
at
the
formation
of
the
society
of
the
city
of
are
such
as
to
impress
this
community
with
the
belief
that
the
colored
population
are
a
growing
evil
immoral
and
destitute
of
religious
principles
resolved
that
we
view
the
resolution
calling
on
the
worshippers
of
christ
to
assist
in
the
unholy
crusade
against
the
colored
population
of
this
country
as
totally
at
variance
with
true
christian
principles
resolved
that
we
claim
country
the
place
of
our
birth
and
not
as
our
mother
country
and
all
attempts
to
send
us
to
africa
we
consider
as
gratuitous
and
uncalled
for
resolved
that
a
committee
of
three
persons
be
appointed
to
draft
an
address
to
the
people
of
and
to
be
published
together
with
these
resolutions

be
signed
by

address
to
the
citizens
of
in
protesting
against
the
sentiments
and
declarations
to
our
prejudice
with
which
the
above
noticed
and
abound
we
are
well
aware
of
the
power
and
influence
we
have
attempted
to
resist
the
gentlemen
named
as
officers
of
the
society
are
men
of
high
standing
their
dictum
is
law
in
morals
with
our
community
but
we
who
feel
the
effect
of
their
proscription
indulge
the
hope
of
an
impartial
hearing
we
believe
many
of
those
gentlemen
are
our
friends
and
we
hope
they
all
mean
well
we
care
not
how
many
colonization
societies
they
form
to
send
slaves
from
the
south
to
a
place
where
they
may
enjoy
freedom
and
if
they
can
the
ocean
with
a
bucket
may
send
their
own
the
increasing
free
colored
population
but
we
solemnly
protest
against
that
christian
philanthropy
which
in
acknowledging
our
wrongs
commits
a
greater
by
vilifying
us
the
conscientious
man
would
not
kill
the
animal
but
cried
dog
and
the
rabble
despatched
him
these
gentlemen
acknowledge
the
anomaly
of
those
political
ethics
which
make
a
distinction
between
man
and
man
when
their
foundation
is
all
men
are
born
equal
and
possess
in
common
rights
and
to
justify
the
withholding
of
these
would
proclaim
to
foreigners
that
we
are
distinct
and
inferior
race
without
religion
or
morals
and
implying
that
our
condition
can
not
be
improved
here
because
there
exists
an
unconquerable
prejudice
in
the
whites
towards
us
we
absolutely
deny
these
positions
and
we
call
upon
the
learned
author
of
the
for
the
indications
of
distinction
between
us
and
other
men
there
are
different
among
all
species
of
animated
creation
a
difference
of
color
is
not
a
difference
of
species
our
structure
and
organization
are
the
same
and
not
distinct
from
other
men
and
in
what
respects
are
we
inferior
our
political
condition
we
admit
renders
us
less
respectable
but
does
it
prove
us
an
inferior
part
of
the
human
family
inferior
indeed
we
are
as
to
the
means
which
we
possess
of
becoming
wealthy
and
learned
men
and
it
would
argue
well
for
the
cause
of
justice
humanity
and
true
religion
if
the
reverend
gentlemen
whose
names
are
found
at
the
bottom
of
president
address
instead
of
showing
their
benevolence
by
laboring
to
move
us
some
four
thousand
miles
off
were
to
engage
actively
in
the
furtherance
of
plans
for
the
improvement
of
our
moral
and
political
condition
in
the
country
of
our
birth
it
is
too
late
now
to
brand
with
inferiority
any
one
of
the
races
of
mankind
we
ask
for
proof
time
was
when
it
was
thought
impossible
to
civilize
the
red
man
yet
our
own
country
presents
a
practical
refutation
of
the
vain
assertion
in
the
flourishing
condition
of
the
cherokees
among
whom
intelligence
and
refinement
are
seen
in
somewhat
fairer
proportions
than
are
exhibited
by
some
of
their
white
neighbors
in
the
language
of
a
writer
of
expanded
views
and
truly
noble
sentiments
blacks
must
be
regarded
as
the
real
authors
of
most
of
the
arts
and
sciences
which
give
the
whites
at
present
the
advantage
over
them
while
greece
and
rome
were
yet
barbarous
we
find
the
light
of
learning
and
improvement
emanating
from
this
by
supposition
degraded
and
accursed
continent
of
africa
out
of
the
midst
of
this
very
thick
lipped
and
coal
black
race
which
some
persons
are
tempted
to
station
at
a
pretty
low
intermediate
point
between
men
and
monkeys
ag
it
is
needless
to
dwell
on
this
topic
and
we
say
with
the
same
writer
the
blacks
had
a
long
and
glorious
day
and
after
what
they
have
been
and
done
it
argues
not
so
much
a
mistaken
theory
as
sheer
ignorance
of
the
most
notorious
historical
facts
to
pretend
that
they
are
naturally
inferior
to
the
whites
we
earnestly
desire
that
this
address
may
not
be
misunderstood
we
have
no
objection
in
the
abstract
to
the
colonization
society
but
we
do
protest
against
the
means
which
that
society
uses
to
effect
its
purposes
it
is
evident
to
any
impartial
observer
that
the
natural
tendency
of
all
their
speeches
reports
sermons
is
to
widen
the
breach
between
us
and
the
whites
and
give
to
prejudice
a
tenfold
vigor
it
has
produced
a
mistaken
sentiment
toward
us
africa
is
considered
the
home
of
those
who
have
never
seen
its
shores
the
poor
ignorant
slave
who
in
all
probability
has
never
heard
the
name
of
christ
by
the
colonization
process
is
suddenly
transformed
into
a
to
instruct
in
the
principles
of
christianity
and
the
arts
of
civilized
life
the
friends
have
been
the
last
to
aid
the
system
pursued
by
the
society
advocates
and
we
say
for
we
feel
it
that
in
proportion
as
they
become
colonizationists
they
become
less
active
and
less
friendly
to
our
welfare
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
there
does
exist
in
the
united
states
a
prejudice
against
us
but
is
it
unconquerable
is
it
not
in
the
power
of
these
gentlemen
to
subdue
it
if
their
object
is
to
benefit
us
why
not
better
our
condition
here
what
keeps
us
down
but
the
want
of
wealth
why
do
we
not
accumulate
wealth
simply
because
we
are
not
encouraged
if
we
wish
to
give
our
boys
a
classical
education
they
are
refused
admission
into
your
colleges
if
we
consume
our
means
in
giving
them
a
mercantile
education
you
will
not
employ
them
as
clerks
if
they
are
taught
navigation
you
will
not
employ
them
as
captains
if
we
make
them
mechanics
you
will
not
encourage
them
nor
will
white
mechanics
work
in
the
same
shop
with
them
and
with
all
these
disabilities
like
a
about
us
because
we
can
not
point
to
our
statesmen
bankers
and
lawyers
we
are
called
an
inferior
race
look
at
the
glaring
injustice
towards
us
a
foreigner
before
he
knows
one
of
our
streets
from
another
mounts
a
cart
under
the
license
of
another
man
or
is
a
public
porter
a
a
watchman
these
gentlemen
know
but
little
of
a
large
portion
of
the
colored
population
of
this
city
their
opinions
are
formed
from
the
unfortunate
portion
of
our
people
whose
characters
are
scrutinized
by
them
as
judges
of
courts
their
patrician
principles
prevent
an
intercourse
with
men
in
the
middle
walks
of
life
among
whom
a
large
portion
of
our
people
may
be
classed
we
ask
them
to
visit
the
dwellings
of
the
respectable
part
of
our
people
and
we
are
satisfied
that
they
will
discover
more
civilization
and
refinement
than
will
be
found
among
the
same
number
of
white
families
of
an
equal
standing
finally
we
hope
that
those
who
have
so
eloquently
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
indian
will
at
least
endeavor
to
preserve
consistency
in
their
conduct
they
put
no
faith
in
georgia
although
she
declares
that
the
indians
shall
not
be
removed
but
their
own
can
they
blame
us
if
we
attach
the
same
credit
to
the
declaration
that
they
mean
to
colonize
us
with
our
consent
they
can
not
indeed
use
force
that
is
out
of
the
question
but
they
harp
so
much
on
and
what
not
that
there
will
no
alternative
be
left
us
but
to
fall
in
with
their
plans
we
are
content
to
abide
where
we
are
we
do
not
believe
that
things
will
always
continue
the
same
the
time
must
come
when
the
declaration
of
independence
will
be
felt
in
the
heart
as
well
as
uttered
from
the
mouth
and
when
the
rights
of
all
shall
be
properly
acknowledged
and
appreciated
god
hasten
that
time
this
is
our
home
and
this
our
country
beneath
its
sod
lie
the
bones
of
our
fathers
for
it
some
of
them
fought

were

a

from

boston
march
pursuant
to
public
notice
a
meeting
was
held
by
the
colored
citizens
of
boston
february
at
their
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
their
sentiments
in
a
remonstrance
against
the
doings
of
the
state
colonization
society
it
was
called
to
order
by
mr
barbadoes
mr
robert

was
elected
chairman
and
mr
james

a
prayer
was
then
offered
up
to
the
throne
of
grace
by
the
rev
mr

the
chairman
having
explained
the
object
of
the
meeting
sundry
resolutions
were
offered
by
mr

and
fairly
discussed
on
motion
a
committee
of
five
was
chosen
to
amend
the
resolutions
and
to
draft
an
address
to
certain
white
citizens
who
had
formed
a
state
society
auxiliary
to
the
american
colonization
society
and
to
the
enlightened
public
john

rev
hosea

thomas

and
thomas
cole
were
placed
on
the
committee
the
committee
to
whom
was
referred
the
subject
of
an
attempt
by
certain
white
citizens
to
establish
in
this
state
a
society
auxiliary
to
the
american
colonization
society
whose
supposed
object
was
the
removal
of
the
free
colored
population
to
western
africa
have
with
diligence
sought
for
and
obtained
every
fact
within
their
reach
relative
to
what
was
enjoined
upon
them
by
the
respectable
body
by
whom
they
were
delegated
and
now
respectfully
report
that
they
have
attended
to
the
duty
with
which
they
were
charged
with
all
the
wisdom
prudence
and
fidelity
which
they
possessed
and
which
the
merits
of
the
case
required
they
therefore
submit
to
the
consideration
of
the
meeting
their
several
conclusions
on
the
subject
the
duty
of
your
committee
seemed
to
be
divided
into
three
general
inquiries
to
ascertain
whether
the
society
above
named
was
truly
established
in
this
metropolis
by
whom
it
was
established
and
for
what
purpose
if
established
for
the
purpose
entertained
by
the
free
colored
population
what
method
should
be
adopted
in
regard
to
expressing
their
disapprobation
thereto
as
to
the
first
inquiry
your
committee
can
state
that
every
doubt
is
now
removed
respecting
the
formation
of
such
a
society
the
proceedings
of
the
meeting
being
published
together
with
the
names
of
the
officers
on
the
second
inquiry
your
committee
refer
you
to
the
article
of
the
constitution
of
said
society
published
in
the
boston
courier
of
which
reads
thus
object
to
which
this
society
shall
be
exclusively
devoted
shall
be
to
aid
the
parent
institution
at
washington
in
the
colonization
of
the
free
people
of
color
of
the
united
states
on
the
coast
of
africa
and
to
do
this
not
only
by
the
contribution
of
money
but
by
the
exertion
of
its
influence
to
promote
the
formation
of
other
societies
we
deem
any
explanation
here
unnecessary
in
regard
to
the
third
and
most
essential
inquiry
your
committee
report
that
they
know
of
no
better
way
of
expressing
their
disapprobation
of
such
measures
than
to
use
every
exertion
to
persuade
their
brethren
not
to
leave
the
united
states
upon
any
consideration
whatever
but
if
there
are
or
should
be
any
exasperated
in
consequence
of
abuse
from
their
white
countrymen
and
who
are
determined
to
leave
the
country
we
think
it
desirable
to
recommend
them
to
hayti
or
upper
canada
where
they
will
find
the
laws
equal
your
committee
deem
it
expedient
also
to
urge
this
duty
upon
the
several
ministers
of
color
throughout
the
united
states
and
all
other
persons
of
color
whose
influence
may
have
any
bearing
in
preventing
their
brethren
from
yielding
to
a
request
so
unjust
and
cruel
and
if
your
respectable
body
should
not
think
your
committee
were
going
beyond
the
bounds
of
their
duty
they
would
recommend
the
clerical
order
throughout
the
united
states
who
have
had
or
who
are
having
any
thing
to
do
with
the
deceptive
scheme
above
alluded
to
to
read
the
chapter
of
ezekiel
read
it
read
it
and
understand
it
your
committee
would
recommend
those
clergymen
who
have
not
defiled
their
garment
with
the
blood
of
the
innocent
to
read
the
and
verses
of
the
chapter
of
proverbs
in
support
of
the
sentiments
thus
expressed
it
becomes
necessary
that
our
reasons
should
accompany
them
why
we
object
to
the
plan
of
dragging
us
to
africa
a
country
to
us
unknown
except
by
geography
in
the
first
place
we
are
told
that
africa
is
our
native
country
consequently
the
climate
will
be
more
congenial
to
our
health
we
readily
deny
the
assertion
how
can
a
man
be
born
in
two
countries
at
the
same
time
is
not
the
position
superficial
to
suppose
that
american
born
citizens
are
africans
in
regard
to
the
climate
what
better
proof
do
we
want
of
its
salubrity
than
to
know
that
of
the
numerous
bodies
who
have
embarked
a
large
portion
of
them
have
immediately
fallen
victims
on
their
arrival
to
the
pestilence
usual
to
that
place
it
is
again
said
that
the
establishment
of
a
colony
on
the
coast
of
africa
will
prevent
the
slave
trade
we
might
as
well
argue
that
a
watchman
in
the
city
of
boston
would
prevent
thievery
in
or
any
other
place
or
that
the
officers
there
would
prevent
goods
being
smuggled
into
any
other
port
of
the
united
states
we
are
aware
that
such
an
unnecessary
expense
devoted
to
the
application
of
a
remedy
so
far
from
the
disease
is
absolutely
contrary
to
common
sense
we
are
sensible
that
the
moral
disease
is
in
america
and
not
in
africa
if
there
was
no
market
for
the
vending
of
slaves
there
would
be
no
inducement
for
the
thief
to
steal
them
the
remedy
for
this
evil
we
humbly
conceive
consists
of
three
general
prescriptions
viz
let
him
who
stealeth
obey
the
word
of
god
and
steal
no
more
let
him
who
hath
encouraged
the
thief
by
purchase
and
consequently
is
a
partaker
with
him
do
so
no
more
let
the
clerical
physicians
who
have
encouraged
and
are
encouraging
both
the
thief
and
the
receiver
by
urging
their
influence
to
the
removal
of
the
means
of
their
detection
desist
therefrom
and
with
their
mighty
weight
of
influence
step
into
the
scale
of
justice
then
will
be
done
away
this
horrible
traffic
in
blood
from
the
above
considerations
we
sincerely
recommend
to
our
white
countrymen
honor
and
humanity
which
will
render
useless
the
transportation
of
the
colored
population
to
the
coast
of
africa
it
being
altogether
gratuitous
and
uncalled
for
we
proceed
to
offer
several
objections
to
the
operation
alluded
to
one
is
the
circumstance
of
the
project
originating
with
those
who
were
deeply
interested
in
slavery
and
who
hold
slaves
as
their
property
we
consider
the
fact
no
evidence
of
the
innocence
of
its
design
we
further
object
because
its
members
admit
slavery
to
be
an
evil
and
use
no
means
to
destroy
it
but
are
exerting
all
their
influence
to
urge
every
free
person
of
color
to
africa
whose
right
to
this
soil
holds
good
with
any
other
citizen
thereby
rivetting
the
chains
of
slavery
stronger
than
ever
upon
their
oppressed
brethren
again
we
object
because
the
whole
spring
of
action
seems
to
originate
in
the
fear
lest
the
free
colored
people
may
whisper
liberty
in
the
ears
of
the
oppressed
we
would
suggest
however
that
they
who
are
fond
of
liberty
should
not
be
annoyed
at
its
sound
from
whatever
source
it
may
come
again
we
object
on
the
ground
of
there
being
sufficient
land
in
the
united
states
on
which
a
colony
might
be
established
that
would
better
meet
the
wishes
of
the
colored
people
and
at
a
much
cheaper
rate
than
could
possibly
be
done
by
sending
them
to
a
howling
wilderness
far
away
and
to
them
unknown
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
newly
formed
society
argued
that
in
case
a
colony
was
formed
for
the
blacks
in
the
united
states
they
would
in
a
short
time
be
removed
as
has
been
the
case
with
the
poor
indians
to
obviate
this
objection
we
here
inform
him
that
hayti
will
hold
all
the
slaves
he
will
send
her
and
as
for
the
free
people
we
expect
they
can
go
where
they
please
either
to
africa
hayti
or
upper
canada
or
remain
at
home
without
asking
the
consent
of
a
slaveholding
party
nor
can
we
conceive
why
free
citizens
acting
this
liberty
should
interfere
with
them
if
they
are
as
they
have
represented
themselves
to
be
honest
and
benevolent
men
we
conceive
that
the
question
in
view
stands
in
two
distinct
points
the
removal
of
the
free
colored
population
from
this
country
or
the
acknowledgment
of
them
as
citizens
the
former
position
must
be
acknowledged
on
all
sides
a
means
of
perpetuating
slavery
in
our
land
the
latter
of
abolishing
it
consequently
it
may
be
seen
who
are
for
the
of
their
country
we
regret
that
our
interest
has
thus
drawn
us
before
the
public
on
account
of
the
regard
we
entertain
towards
many
of
our
warmest
friends
who
have
been
deceived
by
a
cloak
of
philanthropy
smooth
words
and
a
sanctified
appearance
we
remind
them
however
that
the
blood
of
abel
is
beginning
to
be
heard
by
many
who
are
willing
to
acknowledge
that
they
hear
it
we
can
not
close
our
duty
without
gratefully
acknowledging
the
respect
we
entertain
for
those
who
have
defended
our
cause
with
more
than
spartan
courage
it
is
the
opinion
of
your
committee
that
they
are
to
be
respected
as
our
countrymen
our
brethren
and
our
fellow
citizens
not
to
say
they
are
to
be
applauded
as
men
whose
great
acts
are
based
upon
the
acclamation
of
their
fellow
men
but
rather
let
us
hold
up
their
hands
and
let
their
works
praise
them
we
shall
only
add
an
expression
of
our
hopes
that
the
spirit
of
liberty
recently
awakened
in
the
old
world
may
redouble
its
thundering
voice
until
every
tyrant
is
seized
with
a
belshazzar
tremble
at
the
upon
the
wall
of
his
corrupt
palace
in
addition
to
the
above
your
committee
submit
the
following
resolutions
for
your
acceptance
resolved
that
this
meeting
contemplate
with
lively
interest
the
rapid
progress
of
the
sentiments
of
liberty
among
our
degraded
brethren
and
that
we
will
legally
oppose
every
operation
that
may
have
a
tendency
to
perpetuate
our
present
political
condition
resolved
that
this
meeting
look
upon
the
american
colonization
society
as
a
clamorous
abusive
and
combination
resolved
that
this
meeting
look
upon
the
conduct
of
those
clergymen
who
have
filled
the
ears
of
their
respective
congregations
with
the
absurd
idea
of
the
necessity
of
removing
the
free
colored
people
from
the
united
states
as
highly
deserving
the
just
reprehension
directed
to
the
false
prophets
and
priests
by
jeremiah
the
true
prophet
as
recorded
in
the
chapter
of
his
prophecy
resolved
that
this
meeting
appeal
to
a
generous
and
enlightened
public
for
an
impartial
hearing
relative
to
the
subject
of
our
present
political
condition
resolved
that
the
gratitude
of
this
meeting
which
is
so
sensibly
felt
be
fully
expressed
to
those
editors
whose
independence
of
mind
and
correct
views
of
the
rights
of
man
have
led
them
so
fearlessly
to
speak
in
favor
of
our
cause
that
we
rejoice
to
behold
in
them
such
a
strong
desire
to
extend
towards
us
the
inestimable
blessing
in
the
gift
of
a
wise
providence
which
is
demanded
by
all
nature
and
for
which

fathers

regard
to
the
pretensions
of
the
american
colonization
society
william
douglass
was
called
to
the
chair
and
william
watkins
appointed
secretary
the
object
of
the
call
having
been
explicitly
stated
the
meeting
immediately
proceeded
to
the
consideration
of
the
following
resolutions
which
were
unanimously
adopted
on
motion
resolved
that
it
is
the
belief
of
this
meeting
that
the
american
colonization
society
is
founded
more
in
a
selfish
policy
than
in
the
true
principles
of
benevolence
and
therefore
so
far
as
it
regards
the
spring
of
its
operations
is
not
entitled
to
our
confidence
but
should
be
viewed
by
us
with
all
that
caution
and
distrust
which
our
happiness
demands
resolved
that
we
are
not
insensible
to
the
means
usually
employed
by
that
society
and
its
auxiliaries
to
effectuate
our
removal
that
we
sincerely
deprecate
their
gratuitous
and
illiberal
attacks
upon
and
their
too
frequently
exaggerated
statements
of
our
moral
standing
in
the
community
that
such
means
are
unworthy
of
a
magnanimous
people
and
of
a
virtuous
and
noble
cause
resolved
that
we
consider
the
land
in
which
we
were
born
and
in
which
we
have
been
bred
our
only
and
appropriate
and
that
when
desire
to
remove
we
will
apprise
the
public
of
the
same
in
due
season
resolved
that
we
are
deeply
sensible
that
many
of
our
warm
and
sincere
friends
have
espoused
the
colonization
system
from
the
purest
motives
and
that
we
sincerely
regret
their
efforts
to
ameliorate
our
condition
are
not
more
in
accordance
with
our
wishes
resolved
that
the
proceedings
of
this
meeting
be
published
in
the
daily
papers
of
this
city

a
voice
from
washington
washington
may
pursuant
to
previous
notice
a
large
and
very
respectable
meeting
of
the
colored
citizens
of
washington
convened
at
the
african
methodist
episcopal
church
on
wednesday
evening
last
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
their
views
upon
the
subject
of
african
colonization
mr
john
prout
was
called
to
the
chair
and
arthur
waring
was
appointed
secretary
the
chairman
briefly
explained
the
object
of
the
meeting
in
a
short
speech
well
adapted
to
the
occasion
which
was
followed
by
several
neat
and
very
appropriate
addresses
delivered
by
sundry
gentlemen
present
the
following
preamble
and
resolutions
were
offered
and
adopted
nearly
unanimously
whereas
we
consider
that
the
period
has
arrived
for
the
colored
citizens
of
this
place
to
express
their
opinion
upon
the
subject
of
colonization
in
liberia
a
subject
of
great
importance
to
themselves
as
well
as
to
the
colored
citizens
of
the
united
states
generally
and
whereas
our
brethren
at
a
distance
are
desirous
of
obtaining
information
relative
to
the
object
and
policy
pursued
by
the
american
colonization
society
therefore
be
it
resolved
that
this
meeting
view
with
distrust
the
efforts
made
by
the
colonization
society
to
cause
the
free
people
of
color
of
these
united
states
to
emigrate
to
liberia
on
the
coast
of
africa
or
elsewhere
resolved
that
it
is
the
declared
opinion
of
the
members
of
this
meeting
that
the
soil
which
gave
them
birth
is
their
only
and
veritable
and
that
it
would
be
impolitic
unwise
and
improper
for
them
to
leave
their
home
without
the
benefits
of
education
resolved
that
this
meeting
conceive
that
among
the
advocates
of
the
colonization
system
they
have
many
true
and
sincere
friends
and
do
regret
that
their
actions
although
prompted
no
doubt
by
the
purest
motives
do
not
meet
our
approbation
resolved
that
we
believe
the
press
to
be
the
most
efficient
means
of
disseminating
light
and
knowledge
among
our
brethren
and
that
this
meeting
do
acknowledge
with
gratitude
the
efforts
made
in
our
behalf
by
the
editors
of
the
genius
of
universal
emancipation
and
the
liberator
and
do
most
earnestly
recommend
their
respective
papers
to
our
brethren
generally
for
their
approval
and
support
resolved
that
the
foregoing
resolutions
be
signed
by
the
chairman
and
secretary

at
a
numerous
and
respectable
meeting
of
the
colored
inhabitants
of
the
village
and
township
of
brooklyn
convened
in
the
african
hall
for
the
purpose
of
taking
into
consideration
our
views
in
relation
to
the
colonization
society
the
throne
of

was
addressed
by
the
rev
mr

after
which
henry

was
called

the
chair
and
george

appropriate
addresses
were
delivered
by
messrs
george

james
pennington
and
george
woods
the
following
resolutions
were
then
adopted
resolved
unanimously
that
the
call
of
this
meeting
be
approved
of
and
that
the
colored
citizens
of
this
village
have
with
friendly
feelings
taken
into
consideration
the
objects
of
the
american
colonization
society
together
with
all
its
auxiliary
movements
preparatory
for
our
removal
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
we
view
them
as
wholly
gratuitous
not
called
for
by
us
and
not
essential
to
the
real
welfare
of
our
race
that
we
know
of
no
other
country
in
which
we
can
justly
claim
or
demand
our
rights
as
citizens
whether
civil
or
political
but
in
these
united
states
of
america
our
native
soil
and
that
we
shall
be
active
in
our
endeavors
to
convince
the
members
of
the
colonization
society
and
the
public
generally
that
we
are
that
we
are
that
we
are
and
and
demand
an
equal
share
of
protection
from
our
federal
government
with
any
other
class
of
citizens
in
the
community
it
was
also
resolved
that
the
following
persons
viz
james
pennington
henry
thompson
and
george
woods
be
appointed
a
committee
to
draft
an
address
to
the
public
expressing
our
views
more
fully
in
relation
to
the
colonization
society
and
that
a
delegate
be
appointed
to
proceed
to
the
city
of
philadelphia
to
represent
us
in
the
ensuing
convention
which
will
commence
its
sitting
the
inst
to
with
the
measures
that
may
then
be
adopted
for
the
general
welfare
of
our
race
henry
thompson
chairman
george
hogarth
secretary
to
the
colored
citizens
of
brooklyn
n
y
and
its
respected
brethren
and
as
men
and
as
christians
whose
secular
and
eternal
interests
are
the
same
we
are
seriously
called
upon
by
truth
and
reason
and
every
thing
of
which
human
action
is
composed
to
take
into
consideration
the
objects
of
the
american
colonization
society
which
aims
to
remove
us
the
free
people
of
color
from
this
our
beloved
and
native
land
to
the
coast
of
africa
a
country
unknown
to
us
in
every
respect
as
they
propose
to
remove
us
with
our
own
free
will
and
consent
we
do
not
contradict
the
assertion
that
their
objects
in
the
abstract
are
salutary
and
benevolent
but
when
we
hear
those
influential
gentlemen
who
are
advocating
this
cause
generalize
by
language
directly
calculated
to
increase
that
prejudice
which
is
already
one
grand
reason
of
our
wretchedness
we
are
moved
by
a
spirit
of
reliance
upon
justice
and
humanity
to
lift
our
positive
and
decided
voice
against
their
proceedings
and
consider
them
as
a
stigma
upon
our
morals
as
a
people
as
natives
and
citizens
of
this
country
to
whom
equal
rights
are
guaranteed
by
the
declaration
of
independence
when
we
consider
that
by
abridging
men
in
their
moral
liberty
we
touch
their
responsibility
to
the
highest
authority
in
the
universe
we
should
shudder
at
the
thought
of
retaining
such
feelings
as
would
lead
to
any
irreligious
or
impolitic
acts
nor
should
we
be
willing
to
yield
one
particle
of
ours
to
others
unless
it
be
on
the
ground
of
expediency
and
in
some
way
conducive
to
the
glory
of
god
we
are
sorry
to
say
that
those
gentlemen
have
injured
their
cause
and
perhaps
caused
much
good
to
be
evil
spoken
of
by
making
use
of
improper
language
in
their
discussions
upon
our
character
and
condition
in
this
country
without
using
one
effort
to
improve
or
prepare
us
for
the
posts
of
honor
and
distinction
which
they
hold
forth
to
us
whenever
we
set
foot
on
this
much
talked
of
and
long
expected
promised
land
we
would
ask
the
colonization
society
what
are
they
doing
at
home
to
improve
our
condition
it
is
a
true
proverb
that
begins
at
home
how
can
they
extend
their
charities
with
christian
sympathies
and
feeling
some
thousand
miles
across
the
atlantic
ocean
when
they
are
not
willing
with
a
few
exceptions
to
give
us
even
a
christian
instruction
while
among
them
to
prove
the
assertion
we
would
inquire
how
many
of
our
sable
brethren
have
been
elevated
to
any
post
of
distinction
in
this
country
even
in
states
where
our
numbers
have
almost
doubled
have
we
seen
one
statesman
one
officer
or
one
juror
no
in
our
village
and
its
vicinity
how
many
of
us
have
been
educated
in
colleges
and
advanced
into
different
branches
of
business
or
taken
into
mercantile
houses
manufacturing
establishments
are
we
not
even
prohibited
from
some
of
the
common
labor
and
drudgery
of
the
streets
such
as
cartmen
porters
it
is
a
strange
theory
to
us
how
these
gentlemen
can
promise
to
honor
and
respect
us
in
africa
when
they
are
using
every
effort
to
exclude
us
from
all
rights
and
privileges
at
home
they
say
those
of
our
friends
who
look
for
the
day
when
we
shall
have
equal
rights
in
this
country
are
mistaken
may
we
not
accept
it
as
an
assurance
that
they
will
do
all
they
can
to
prevent
us
from
arriving
to
any
degree
of
respectability
at
home
in
our
own
land
away
then
with
such
false
sympathies
and
friendships
they
are
as
foreign
to
us
as
the
coast
of
africa
we
truly
believe
that
many
gentlemen
who
are
engaged
in
the
colonization
society
are
our
sincere
friends
and
they
wish
to
do
something
for
us
consequently
they
have
subscribed
largely
to
it
because
there
was
no
other
plan
on
foot
some
of
them
have
been
deluded
into
its
schemes
with
a
view
of
thoroughly
civilizing
and
christianizing
africa
by
our
free
people
of
color
and
emancipated
slaves
who
may
from
time
to
time
be
colonized
on
its
coasts
with
their
consent
we
conceive
that
such
measures
are
fraught
with
inconsistency
and
in
no
way
calculated
to
have
such
an
effect
to
send
a
parcel
of
uninstructed
uncivilized
and
unchristianized
people
to
the
western
coast
of
africa
with
bibles
in
their
hands
to
teach
the
natives
the
truths
of
the
gospel
social
happiness
and
moral
virtue
is
mockery
and
ridicule
in
the
extreme
missionary
families
should
be
well
instructed
in
the
rudiments
of
our
holy
religion
that
their
example
may
shine
forth
as
lights
in
that
much
neglected
and
benighted
land
we
are
much
in
favor
of
christianizing
africa
but
not
according
to
the
plans
of
the
colonization
society
to
purchase
their
lands
of
them
with
a
few
paltry
guns
beads
and
then
establish
forts
and
garrisons
to
protect
traders
and
traffickers
without
perhaps
once
naming
the
religion
of
jesus
to
them
we
well
know
that
the
examples
of
traders
and
traffickers
are
in
no
way
calculated
to
induce
heathens
to
embrace
our
religion
for
example
we
will
refer
to
the
early
settlements
of
our
american
colonies
and
inquire
what
religious
impressions
did
the
settlers
make
who
were
wise
and
learned
from
europe
upon
the
aborigines
of
our
country
we
believe
that
a
few
men
well
instructed
and
possessing
a
true
missionary
spirit
are
calculated
to
do
more
good
in
that
country
than
a
thousand
on
the
colonization
plan
many
wish
us
to
go
to
africa
because
they
say
that
our
constitutions
are
better
adapted
to
that
climate
than
this
if
so
we
would
ask
why
so
many
of
our
hearty
hale
and
healthy
brethren
on
arriving
in
that
country
fall
victims
to
the
malignant
fevers
and
disorders
prevalent
in
those
regions
we
would
observe
that
none
are
exempt
from
being
touched
with
the
contagion
it
operates
more
severely
upon
those
from
the
higher
latitudes
some
of
our
brethren
have
come
to
the
conclusion
to
leave
this
country
with
all
its
prejudices
and
seek
an
asylum
in
foreign
climes
we
would
recommend
to
your
serious
consideration
the
location
in
upper
canada
a
place
far
better
adapted
to
our
constitutions
our
habits
and
our
morals
where
prejudice
has
not
such
an
unlimited
sway
where
you
will
be
surrounded
by
christians
and
have
an
opportunity
to
become
civilized
and
christianized
brethren
it
is
time
for
us
to
awake
to
our
interests
for
the
colonization
society
is
straining
every
nerve
for
the
accomplishment
of
its
objects
by
their
last
publications
we
see
that
they
have
invoked
all
christian
assemblies
and
churches
throughout
the
union
to
exert
their
influence
by
raising
subscriptions
to
send
us
the
strangers
within
their
gates
as
they
call
us
to
the
coast
of
africa
they
have
got
the
consent
of
eleven
states
who
have
instructed
their
senators
to
do
something
in
the
next
congress
for
our
removal
maryland
calls
imperatively
on
the
general
government
to
send
us
away
or
else
they
will
colonize
their
own
free
blacks
they
have
by
their
influence
stopped
the
emancipation
of
slaves
in
a
measure
except
for
colonization
purposes
we
owe
a
tribute
of
respect
to
the
state
of
for
her
not
having
entered
into
the
confederacy
though
she
is
the
last
in
proclaiming
general
emancipation
to
the
slave
yet
we
find
her
slow
in
adopting
any
such
unchristian
measures
we
may
well
say
she
is
deliberate
in
her
councils
and
determinate
in
her
resolutions
finally
brethren
we
are
not
strangers
neither
do
we
come
under
the
alien
law
our
constitution
does
not
call
upon
us
to
become
naturalized
we
are
already
american
citizens
our
fathers
were
among
the
first
that
peopled
this
country
their
sweat
and
their
tears
have
been
the
means
in
a
measure
of
raising
our
country
to
its
present
standing
many
of
them
fought
and
bled
and
died
for
the
gaining
of
her
liberties
and
shall
we
forsake
their
tombs
and
flee
to
an
unknown
land
no
let
us
remain
over
them
and
weep
until
the
day
arrive
when
ethiopia
shall
stretch
forth
her
hands
to
god
we
were
born
and
nurtured
in
this
christian
land
and
are
surrounded
by
christians
whose
sacred
creed
is
to
do
unto
all
men
as
ye
would
they
should
do
unto
you
to
love
our
neighbors
as
ourselves
and
which
expressly
declares
if
we
have
respect
to
persons
we
commit
sin
let
us
brethren
invoke
the
christian
god
in
our
behalf
to
do
away
the
prejudices
of
our
brethren
that
they
may
adopt
the
solemn
truths
of
the
gospel
and
acknowledge
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
that
he
has
made
of
one
blood
all
the
nations
that
dwell
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
they
may
no
longer
bring
their
reasonings
in
contact
with
the
omniscience
of
deity
and
insinuate
to
the
public
that
our
intellect
and
faculties
are
measurably
inferior
to
those
of
our
fairer
brethren
because
adversity
has
thrown
a
veil
over
us
and
we
whom
god
has
created
to
worship
admire
and
adore
his
divine
attributes
shall
we
be
held
in
a
state
of
wretchedness
and
degradation
with
monkeys
baboons
slaves
and
cattle
because
we
possess
a
darker
hue
we
feel
it
our
duty
ever
to
remain
true
to
the
constitution
of
our
country
and
to
protect
it
as
we
have
always
done
from
foreign
aggressions
although
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
of
us
are
virtually
deprived
of
the
rights
and
immunities
of
citizens
and
more
than
two
millions
held
in
abject
slavery
yet
we
know
that
god
is
just
and
ever
true
to
his
purpose
before
him
the
whole
world
stands
in
awe
and
at
his
command
nations
must
obey
he
who
has
lately
pleaded
the
indian
cause
in
our
land
and
who
has
brought
about
many
signal
events
to
the
astonishment
of
our
generation
we
believe
is
in
the
whirlwind
and
will
soon
bring
about
the
time
when
the
sable
sons
of
america
will
join
with
their
fairer
brethren
and
liberty
and
equal
rights
in
all
parts
of
columbia
soil
we
pray
the
lord
to
hasten
the
day
when
prejudice
inferiority
degradation
and
oppression
shall
be
done
away
and
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
become
the
kingdoms
of
our
god
and

hartford
july
at
a
large
and
respectable
meeting
of
the
colored
inhabitants
of
the
city
of
hartford
and
its
vicinity
convened
at
the
vestry
room
of
the
african
church
on
the
inst
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
their
views
in
relation
to
the
american
colonization
society
mr
henry
foster
was
called
to
the
chair
and
mr
paul
drayton
appointed
secretary
the
object
of
the
meeting
was
then
stated
in
a
brief
and
pertinent
manner
after
which
extracts
from
several
speeches
delivered
by
the
founders
of
the
colonization
scheme
together
with
the
general
sentiments
of
colonizationists
extracted
from
the
african
repository
were
laid
before
the
meeting
and
the
following
resolutions
were
unanimously
adopted
resolved
that
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
the
american
colonization
society
is
actuated
by
the
same
motives
which
influenced
the
mind
of
pharaoh
when
he
ordered
the
male
children
of
the
israelites
to
be
destroyed
resolved
that
it
is
the
belief
of
this
meeting
that
the
society
is
the
greatest
foe
to
the
free
colored
and
slave
population
with
whom
liberty
and
equality
have
to
contend
resolved
that
we
look
upon
the
man
of
color
that
would
be
influenced
by
the
society
to
emigrate
to
liberia
as
an
enemy
to
the
cause
and
a
traitor
to
his
brethren
resolved
that
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
many
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
this
unjust
scheme
would
be
willing
if
it
were
in
their
power
to
place
us
before
the
point
of
the
bayonet
and
drive
us
out
of
existence
so
that
they
may
get
rid
of
that
dark
cloud
as
we
are
termed
which
hangs
over
these
united
states
resolved
that
in
our
belief
we
have
committed
no
crime
worthy
of
banishment
and
that
we
will
resist
all
the
attempts
of
the
colonization
society
to
banish
us
from
this
our
native
land
resolved
that
we
consider
ourselves
the
legitimate
sons
of
these
united
states
from
whence
we
will
never
consent
to
be
transported
resolved
that
we
will
resist
even
unto
death
all
the
attempts
of
this
society
to
transport
us
to
the
pestilential
shores
of
liberia
resolved
that
we
will
not
countenance
the
doctrine
of
any
pretended
minister
of
the
gospel
who
is
in
league
with
those
conspirators
against
our
rights
we
would
therefore
warn
them
to
beware
of
following
the
footsteps
of
balaam
who
taught
balak
to
cast
a
stumbling
block
in
the
way
of
the
children
of
israel
for
we
verily
believe
that
if
god
almighty
have
to
deliver
his
people
by
his
mighty
arm
of
power
they
will
share
the
fate
of
that
false
prophet
resolved
that
though
we
be
last
in
calling
a
meeting
we
feel
no
less
the
pernicious
influence
of
this
society
than
the
rest
of
our
brethren
and
that
we
consider
all
their
pretexts
whether
under
the
cloak
of
religion
or
philanthropy
gratuitous
and
uncalled
for
we
would
therefore
advise
the
society
that
as
we
have
learned
that
there
are
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
its
funds
it
had
better
appropriate
this
sum
in
meliorating
the
condition
of
our
brethren
the
slaves
in
this
their
native
land
and
raising
them
from
that
degradation
into
which
they
are
plunged
resolved
that
the
thanks
of
the
meeting
be
returned
to
messrs
william
lloyd
garrison
isaac
knapp
and
every
friend
of
emancipation
for
their
benevolent
exertions
in
our
behalf

it
was
warmly

freely
addressed
by

when
on
motion
it
was
resolved
that
the
proceedings
of
our
brethren
in
brooklyn
meet
our
entire
approbation
they
breathe
our
sentiments
in
full
and
may
our
voices
cheerfully
accord
with
them
in
protesting
against
leaving
this
our
native
soil
why
should
we
leave
this
land
so
dearly
bought
by
the
blood
groans
and
tears
of
our
fathers
truly
this
is
our
home
here
let
us
live
and
here
let
us
die
what
emigrate
to
liberia
a
land
so
detrimental
to
our
health
we
have
now
before
us
a
letter
written
by
a
friend
who
emigrated
from
this
place
to
the
burning
shores
of
africa
in
hopes
of
splendor
wealth
and
ease
and
he
says
that
and
distress
prevail
to
a
great
extent
and
it
is
a
clear
case
that
those
who
come
from
the
united
states
must
undergo
a
long
and
protracted
sickness
with
this
country
fever
and
i
would
not
advise
my
friends
to
emigrate

mr
henry
berrian
was
called
to
the
chair
and
mr
henry
merriman
was
appointed
secretary
the
following
resolutions
were
then
unanimously
adopted
resolved
that
we
consider
those
christians
and
philanthropists
who
are
boasting
of
their
liberty
and
equality
saying
that
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
and
yet
are
endeavoring
to
remove
us
from
our
native
land
to
be
inhuman
in
their
proceedings
defective
in
their
principles
and
unworthy
of
our
confidence
resolved
that
we
consider
those
colonizationists
and
ministers
of
the
gospel
who
are
advocating
our
transportation
to
an
unknown
clime
because
our
skin
is
a
little
darker
than
theirs
notwithstanding
god
has
made
of
one
blood
all
nations
of
men
and
has
no
respect
of
persons
as
violaters
of
the
commandments
of
god
and
the
laws
of
the
bible
and
as
trying
to
blind
our
eyes
by
their
vain
movements
their
mouths
being
smooth
as
oil
and
their
words
sharper
than
any
sword
resolved
that
while
we
have
no
doubt
of
the
sinister
motives
of
the
great
body
of
colonizationists
we
believe
some
of
them
are
our
friends
and
who
have
not
looked
deeply
into
the
subject
but
when
they
make
a
careful
examination
we
think
they
will
find
themselves
in
error
resolved
that
it
is
our
earnest
desire
that
africa
may
speedily
become
civilized
and
receive
religious
instruction
but
not
by
the
absurd
and
invidious
plan
of
the
colonization
society
namely
to
send
a
nation
of
ignorant
men
to
teach
a
nation
of
ignorant
men
we
think
it
most
wise
for
them
to
send
missionaries
resolved
that
we
will
resist
all
attempts
made
for
our
removal
to
the
torrid
shores
of
africa
and
will
sooner
suffer
every
drop
of
blood
to
be
taken
from
our
veins
than
submit
to
such
unrighteous
treatment
resolved
that
we
know
of
no
other
place
that
we
can
call
our
true
and
appropriate
home
excepting
these
united
states
into
which
our
fathers
were
brought
who
enriched
the
country
by
their
toils
and
fought
bled
and
died
in
its
defence
and
left
us
in
its
possession
and
here
we
will
live
and
die
resolved
that
we
consider
the
american
colonization
society
founded
on
principles
that
no
unless
very
weak
in
mind
will
follow
and
any
man
who
will
be
persuaded
to
leave
his
own
country
and
go
to
africa
as
an
enemy
to
his
country
and
a
traitor
to
his
brethren
resolved
that
we
have
heard
with
pleasure
of
the
proceedings
of
our
brethren
in
neighboring
cities
and
that
a
number
of
this
society
will
willingly
become
auxiliary
to
the
parent
society
of
philadelphia
for
the
mutual
benefit
of
the
throughout
the

into

mr
james

appointed

a
prayer
was
then
offered
to
the
throne
of
grace
by
mr
smith
the
chairman
called
the
house
to
order
and
explained
the
object
of
the
meeting
in
a
few
preliminary
remarks
after
which
the
meeting
proceeded
to
business
and
adopted
the
subsequent
resolutions
resolved
that
we
view
the
country
in
which
we
live
as
our
only
true
and
appropriate
home
and
let
colonizationists
pour
contempt
upon
our
race
and
slaveholders
look
on
our
brethren
as
a
nuisance
to
the
country
yet
here
will
we
live
here
were
we
born
this
is
the
country
for
which
some
of
our
ancestors
fought
and
bled
and
conquered
nor
shall
a
conspiring
world
be
able
to
drive
us
hence
resolved
that
it
is
our
firm
belief
that
the
colonization
society
is
replete
with
infinite
mischief
and
that
we
view
all
the
arguments
of
its
advocates
as
mere
sophistry
not
worthy
our
notice
as
freemen
being
citizens
of
these
united
states
we
could
call
upon
our
brethren
to
awake
from
their
slumber
of
ignorance
break
the
chain
of
prejudice
that
has
so
long
bound
them
and
in
the
strength
of
the
omnipotent
spirit
give
their
hearts
to
god
resolved
that
we
will
resist
all
attempts
to
send
us
to
the
burning
shores
of
africa
beware
of
alexander
the
coppersmith
for
he
hath
done
us
much
harm
may
the
lord
reward
him
we
verily
believe
that
if
by
an
extraordinary
perversion
of
nature
every
man
and
woman
in
one
night
should
become
white
the
colonization
society
would
fall
like
lightning
to
the
earth
resolved
that
we
will
not
be
duped
out
of
our
rights
as
freemen
by
colonizationists
nor
by
any
other
combination
of
men
all
the
encomiums
pronounced
upon
liberia
can
never
form
the
least
temptation
to
induce
us
to
leave
our
native
soil
to
emigrate
to
a
strange
land
resolved
that
we
readily
coalesce
with
our
brethren
in
the
different
towns
and
cities
and
take
the
liberty
to
say
that
we
as
a
little
flock
feel
a
fixed
resolution
to
maintain
our
ground
till
the
great
author
of
our
being
shall
say
to
those
who
deprive
us
of
our
rights
thus
saith
the
lord
because
ye
have
not
hearkened
to
me
in
proclaiming
liberty
every
one
to
his
brother
and
every
man
to
his
neighbor
behold
i
will
proclaim
liberty
for
you
saith
the
lord
to
the
sword
to
the
pestilence
and
to
the
famine
resolved
that
it
is
the
decided
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
african
colonization
is
a
scheme
of
southern
policy
a
wicked
device
of
slaveholders
who
are
desirous
of
riveting
more
firmly
and
perpetuating
more
certainly
the
fetters
of
slavery
who
are
only
anxious
to
rid
themselves
of
a
population
whose
presence
influence
and
example
have
a
tendency
as
they
suppose
to
produce
discontent
among
the
slaves
and
to
furnish
them
with
incitements
to
rebellion
resolved
that
this
meeting
will
not
encourage
a
scheme
which
has
for
its
basis
prejudice
and
hatred
though
there
may
be
some
good
wheat
yet
it
is
to
be
feared
the
enemy
has
sown
tares
among
it
resolved
that
we
will
support
the
colony
at
canada
the
climate
being
healthier
better
adapted
to
our
constitutions
and
far
more
consonant
with
our
views
than
that
of
africa
resolved
that
we
unanimously
agree
to
patronize
the
liberator
and
use
our
best
endeavors
to
get
subscribers
for
the
same
and
that
we
are
under
renewed
obligations
to
god
that
he
ever
raised
up
such
honest
hearted
men
as
messrs
garrison
and
knapp
resolved
that
this
meeting
cause
its
proceedings
to
be
sent
to
the
liberator
for
publication
praying
that
the
lord
will
succeed
all
the
lawful
efforts
of
its
conductor
to
meliorate
the
condition
of
our
brethren
in
these
united
states

his
weapons

the

into
consideration
the
objects
of
the
colonization
society
together
with
its
movements
preparatory
for
our
removal
to

and
we
view
them
as
wholly
gratuitous
not
called
for
by
us
and
in
no
way
essential
to
the
welfare
of
our
race

believe
that
our
condition
can
be
best
improved
in
this
our
own
country
and
native
soil
the
united

of

resolved
that
we
hold
this
truth
to
be
that
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
and
we
are
men
and
therefore
ought
to
share
as
much
protection
and
enjoy
as
many
privileges
under
our
federal
government
as
any
other
class
of

will
be
zealous
in
doing
all
that
lies
in
our
power
to
improve
the
condition
of
ourselves
and
brethren
in
this
our
native
land
resolved
that
there
is
no
philanthropy
towards
the
people
of
color
in
the
colonization
plan
but
that
it
is
got
up
to
delude
us
away
from
our
country
and
home
into
a
country
of
sickness
and
death
resolved
that
the
thanks
of
this

be

and
in
an

manner
by

the
following
resolutions
were
then
unanimously

that
hold
these

to
be
that
all

are
created

and
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
liberty
and
equality
now
liberty
and
equality
forever
resolved
that
it
is
the
decided
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
african
colonization
is
a
scheme
to
drain
the
better
informed
part
of
the
colored
people
out
of
these
united
states
so
that
the
chain
of
slavery
may
be
rivetted
more
tightly
but
we
are
determined
not
to
be
cheated
out
of
our
rights
by
the
colonization
men
or
any
other
set
of
intriguers
we
believe
there
is
no
philanthropy
in
the

plan
towards
the

but
that
it
is
got
up
to
delude
us
away
from
our
country
and
home
to
the
burning
shores
of
africa
resolved
that
we
the
colored
people
of
pittsburgh
and
citizens
of
these
united
states
view
the
country
in
which
we
live
as
our
only
true
and
proper
home
we
are
just
as
much
natives
here
as
the
members
of
the
colonization
society
here
we
were
born
here
bred
here
are
our
earliest
and
most
pleasant
associations
here
is
all
that
binds
man
to
earth
and
makes
life
valuable
and
we
do
consider
every
colored
man
who
allows
himself
to
be
colonized
in
africa
or
elsewhere
a
traitor
to
our
cause
resolved
that
we
are
freemen
that
we
are
brethren
that
we
are
countrymen
and
and
as
fully
entitled
to

view
with
deep
regret
the
attempt
now
making
to
colonize
the
free
people
of

on
the
western
coast
of
africa
believing
as
we
do
that
it
is
inimical
to
the
best
interests
of
the
people
of
color
and
at
variance
with
the
principles
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
wholly
incompatible
with
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
declaration
of
independence
of
these
united
states
resolved
that
we
disclaim
all
connexion
with
africa
and
although
the
descendants
of
that
much
afflicted
country
we
can
not
consent
to
remove
to
any
tropical
climate
and
thus
aid
in
a
design
having
for
its
object
the
total
extirpation
of
our
race
from

to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
resolved
that

be

as
soon
as
practicable

our
views

we
the
undersigned
in
conformity
to
the
wishes
of
our
brethren
beg
leave
to
present
to
the
public
in
a
calm
and
unprejudiced
manner
our
decided
and
unequivocal
disapprobation
of
the
american
colonization
society
and
its
auxiliaries
in
relation
to
the
free
people
of
color
in
the
united
states
convinced
as
we
are
that
the
operations
of
this
society
have
been
unchristian
and
in
principle
and
at
variance
with
our
best
interests
as
a
people
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
precepts
of
religion
the
dictates
of
justice
and
humanity
would
have
prevented
any
considerable
portion
of
the
community
from
lending
their
aid
to
a
plan
which
we
fear
was
designed
to
deprive
us
of
rights
that
the
declaration
of
independence
declares
are
the
rights
of
all
men
we
were
content
to
remain
silent
believing
that
the
justice
and
patriotism
of
a
magnanimous
people
would
prevent
the
annals
of
our
native
and
beloved
country
from
receiving
so
deep
a
stain
but
observing
the
growing
strength
and
influence
of
that
institution
and
being
well
aware
that
the
generality
of
the
public
are
unacquainted
with
our
views
on
this
important
subject
we
feel
it
a
duty
we
owe
to
ourselves
our
children
and
posterity
to
enter
our
protest
against
a
device
so
fraught
with
evil
to
us
that
many
sincere
friends
to
our
race
are
engaged
in
what
they
conceive
to
be
a
philanthropic
and
benevolent
enterprise
we
do
not
hesitate
to
admit
but
that
they
are
deceived
and
are
acting
in
a
manner
calculated
most
seriously
to
injure
the
free
people
of
color
we
are
equally
sensible
we
are
natives
of
the
united
states
our
ancestors
were
brought
to
this
country
by
means
over
which
they
had
no
control
we
have
our
attachments
to
the
soil
and
we
feel
that
we
have
rights
in
common
with
other
americans
and
although
deprived
through
prejudice
from
entering
into
the
full
enjoyment
of
those
rights
we
anticipate
a
period
when
in
despite
of
the
more
than
ordinary
prejudice
which
has
been
the
result
of
this
unchristian
scheme
shall
stretch
forth
her
hands
to
god
but
that
this
formidable
society
has
become
a
barrier
to
our
improvement
must
be
apparent
to
every
individual
who
will
but
reflect
on
the
course
to
be
pursued
by
the
emissaries
of
this
unhallowed
project
many
of
whom
under
the
name
of
ministers
of
the
gospel
use
their
influence
to
turn
public
sentiment
to
our
disadvantage
by
stigmatizing
our
morals
misrepresenting
our
characters
and
endeavoring
to
show
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
the
sound
policy
of
perpetuating
our
civil
and
political
disabilities
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
indirectly
forcing
us
to
emigrate
to
the
western
coast
of
africa
that
africa
is
neither
our
nation
nor
home
a
due
respect
to
the
good
sense
of
the
community
forbids
us
to
attempt
to
prove
that
our
language
habits
manners
morals
and
religion
are
all
different
from
those
of
africans
is
a
fact
too
notorious
to
admit
of
controversy
why
then
are
we
called
upon
to
go
and
settle
in
a
country
where
we
must
necessarily
be
and
remain
a
distinct
people
having
no
common
interest
with
the
numerous
inhabitants
of
that
vast
and
extensive
country
experience
has
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
climate
is
such
as
not
to
suit
the
constitutions
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
country
the
fevers
and
various
diseases
incident
to
that
tropical
clime
are
such
as
in
most
cases
to
bid
defiance
to
the
force
of
medicine
the
very
numerous
instances
of
mortality
amongst
the
emigrants
who
have
been
induced
to
leave
this
their
native
for
their
adopted
country
clearly
demonstrate
the
fallacy
of
those
statements
so
frequently
made
by
the
advocates
of
colonization
in
regard
to
the
healthiness
of
liberia
with
the
deepest
regret
we
have
witnessed
such
an
immense
sacrifice
of
life
in
advancing
a
cause
which
can
not
promise
the
least
advantage
to
the
free
people
of
color
who
it
was
said
were
the
primary
objects
to
be
benefitted
by
this
enterprise
but
we
beg
leave
most
respectfully
to
ask
the
friends
of
african
colonization
whether
their
christian
benevolence
can
not
in
this
country
be
equally
as
advantageously
applied
if
they
are
actuated
by
that
disinterested
spirit
of
love
and
friendship
for
us
which
they
profess
have
not
they
in
the
united
states
a
field
sufficiently
extensive
to
show
it
in
there
is
embosomed
within
this
republic
rising
one
million
free
people
of
color
the
greater
part
of
whom
are
unable
to
read
even
the
sacred
scriptures
is
not
their
ignorant
and
degraded
situation
worthy
of
the
consideration
of
those
enlightened
and
christian
individuals
whose
zeal
for
the
cause
of
the
african
race
has
induced
them
to
attempt
the
establishment
of
a
republican
form
of
government
amid
the
burning
sands
of
liberia
and
the
evangelizing
of
the
millions
of
the
mahometans
and
pagans
that
inhabit
the
interior
of
that
extensive
country
we
are
constrained
to
believe
that
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
color
to
say
the
least
is
but
a
secondary
consideration
with
those
engaged
in
the
colonization
project
or
why
should
we
be
requested
to
move
to
africa
and
thus
separated
from
all
we
hold
dear
in
a
moral
point
of
view
before
their
christian
benevolence
can
be
exercised
in
our
behalf
surely
there
is
no
country
of
which
we
have
any
knowledge
that
offers
greater
facilities
for
the
improvement
of
the
unlearned
or
where
benevolent
and
philanthropic
individuals
can
find
a
people
whose
situation
has
greater
claims
on
their
christian
sympathies
than
the
people
of
color
but
whilst
we
behold
a
settled
determination
on
the
part
of
the
american
colonization
society
to
remove
us
to
liberia
without
using
any
means
to
better
our
condition
at
home
we
are
compelled
to
look
with
fearful
diffidence
on
every
measure
of
that
institution
at
a
meeting
held
on
the
inst
in
this
borough
the
people
of
color
were
politely
invited
to
attend
the
object
of
which
was
to
induce
the
most
respectable
part
of
them
to
emigrate
the
meeting
was
addressed
by
several
reverend
gentlemen
and
very
flattering
accounts
given
on
the
authority
of
letters
and
statements
said
to
have
been
received
from
individuals
of
unquestionable
veracity
but
we
beg
leave
to
say
that
those
statements
differ
so
widely
from
letters
that
we
have
seen
of
recent
date
from
the
colony
in
regard
to
the
condition
and
circumstances
of
the
colonists
that
we
are
compelled
in
truth
to
say
that
we
can
not
reconcile
such
contradictory
statements
and
are
therefore
inclined
to
doubt
the
former
as
they
appear
to
have
been
prepared
to
present
to
the
public
for
the
purpose
of
enlisting
the
feelings
of
our
white
friends
into
the
measure
and
of
inducing
the
enterprising
part
of
the
colored
community
to
emigrate
at
their
own
expense
that
we
are
in
this
country
a
degraded
people
we
are
truly
sensible
that
our
forlorn
situation
is
not
attributable
to
ourselves
is
admitted
by
the
most
ardent
friends
of
colonization
and
that
our
condition
can
not
be
bettered
by
removing
the
most
exemplary
individuals
of
color
from
amongst
us
we
are
well
convinced
from
the
consideration
that
in
the
same
ratio
that
the
industrious
part
would
emigrate
in
the
same
proportion
those
who
would
remain
would
become
more
degraded
wretched
and
miserable
and
consequently
less
capable
of
appreciating
the
many
opportunities
which
are
now
offering
for
the
moral
and
intellectual
improvement
of
our
brethren
we
therefore
a
portion
of
those
who
are
the
objects
of
this
plan
and
amongst
those
whose
happiness
with
that
of
others
of
our
color
it
is
intended
to
promote
respectfully
but
firmly
disclaim
every
connexion
with
it
and
declare
our
settled
determination
not
to
participate
in
any
part
of
it
but
if
this
plan
is
intended
to
facilitate
the
emancipation
of
those
who
are
held
in
slavery
in
the
south
and
the
melioration
of
their
condition
by
sending
them
to
liberia
we
question
very
much
whether
it
is
calculated
to
do
either
that
the
emancipation
of
slaves
has
been
measurably
impeded
through
its
influence
except
where
they
have
been
given
up
to
the
board
of
managers
to
be
colonized
in
africa
to
us
is
manifest
and
when
we
contemplate
their
uneducated
and
vitiated
state
destitute
of
the
arts
and
unaccustomed
to
provide
even
for
themselves
we
are
inevitably
led
to
the
conclusion
that
their
situation
in
that
pestilential
country
will
be
miserable
in
the
extreme
the
present
period
is
one
of
deep
and
increasing
interest
to
the
free
people
of
color
relieved
from
the
miseries
of
slavery
and
its
concomitant
evils
with
the
vast
and
to
us
unexplored
field
of
literature
and
science
before
us
surrounded
by
many
friends
whose
sympathies
and
charities
need
not
the
atlantic
between
us
and
them
before
they
can
consent
to
assist
in
elevating
our
brethren
to
the
standing
of
men
we
therefore
particularly
invite
their
attention
to
the
subject
of
education
and
improvement
sensible
that
it
is
much
better
calculated
to
remove
prejudice
and
exalt
our
moral
character
than
any
system
of
colonization
that
has
been
or
can
be
introduced
and
in
which
we
believe
we
shall
have
the
of
the
wisest
and
most
philanthropic
individuals
of
which
the
nation
can
boast
the
utility
of
learning
and
its
salutary
effects
on
the
minds
and
morals
of
a
people
can
not
have
escaped
the
notice
of
any
rational
individual
situated
in
a
country
like
this
where
in
order
successfully
to
prosecute
any
mechanical
or
other
business
education
is
indispensable
our
highest
moral
ambition
at
present
should
be
to
acquire
for
our
children
a
liberal
education
give
them
mechanical
trades
and
thus
fit
and
prepare
them
for
useful
and
respectable
citizens
and
leave
the
evangelizing
of
africa
and
the
establishing
of
a
republic
at
liberia
to
those
who
conceive
themselves
able
to
demonstrate
the
practicability
of
its
accomplishment
by
means
of
a
people
numbers
of
whom
are
more
ignorant
than
even
the
natives
of
that
country
themselves
in
conclusion
we
feel
it
a
pleasing
duty
ever
to
cherish
a
grateful
respect
for
those
benevolent
and
truly
philanthropic
individuals
who
have
advocated
and
still
are
advocating
our
rights
in
our
native
country
their
indefatigable
zeal
in
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
will
never
be
forgotten
by
us
and
unborn
millions
will
bless
their
names
in
the
day
when
the
creator
in
whom
we
trust
shall
have
bidden

rev

in
some
concise
remarks
equalled
by

and
exceeded
by
none
expressed
the
object
of
the
meeting
the
chairman
called
the
house
to
order
and
the
following
resolutions
were
unanimously
acceded
to
resolved
that
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
and
it
is
the
boasted
declaration
of
our
independence
that
all
men
black
and
white
poor
and
rich
are
born
free
and
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
this
is
the
language
of
america
of
reason
and
of
eternal
truth
resolved
that
we
feel
it
to
be
our
duty
to
be
true
to
the
constitution
of
our
country
and
are
satisfied
with
the
form
of
government
under
which
we
now
live
and
moreover
that
we
are
bound
in
duty
and
reason
to
protect
it
against
foreign
invasion
we
always
have
done
so
and
will
do
so
still
resolved
that
we
view
the
efforts
of
the
colonization
society
as
officious
and
uncalled
for
by
us
we
have
never
done
any
thing
worthy
of
banishment
from
our
friends
and
home
but
this
we
would
say
if
the
colonization
society
will
use
their
best
endeavors
to
get
our
slave
brethren
transported
to
liberia
when
we
as
a
free
body
of
people
wish
to
go
we
will
give
the
colonizationists
timely
notice
resolved
that
it
is
the
firm
and
decided
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
were
there
no
free
people
of
color
among
us
or
if
those
who
are
free
had
remained
in
the
degraded
character
of
slaves
or
as
they
sometimes
call
us
monkeys
apes
and
baboons
they
would
never
have
got
up
the
chimerical
scheme
for
our
transportation
to
the
burning
shores
of
africa
with
the
fancied
vision
of
elevating
us
as
they
say
to
dignity
and
affluence
resolved
that
we
can
not
remain
inactive
while
colonizationists
are
straining
every
nerve
and
racking
their
inventions
to
find
out
arguments
to
persuade
our
free
colored
brethren
to
migrate
to
an
unknown
land
which
we
can
no
more
lay
claim
to
than
our
white
brethren
can
to
england
or
any
other
foreign
country
resolved
that
we
reject
the
inhuman
and
unchristian
measures
taken
by
the
colonization
society
for
the
illumination
of
the
colored
citizens
of
the
united
states
their
appropriate
home
in
a
land
of
sickness
affliction
and
death
when
they
are
not
willing
with
few
exceptions
to
give
us
a
christian
education
while
among
them
we
would
wish
to
know
of
the
colonizationists
how
in
the
name
of
common
sense
and
reason
do
they
expect
to
do
any
thing
for
us
thousands
of
miles
across
the
atlantic
when
they
oppose
almost
every
measure
taken
by
our
white
friends
and
brethren
to
improve
our
condition
here
resolved
that
it
is
the
united
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
the
enemies
of
our
race
who
are
members
of
the
colonization
society
see
that
the
great
author
of
universal
existence
who
no
respecter
of
persons
who
taught
balaam
ass
to
speak
and
taught
solomon
wisdom
is
now
enlightening
the
sable
sons
of
america
hence
their
object
to
drain
the
country
of
the
most
enlightened
part
of
our
colored
brethren
so
that
they
may
be
more
able
to
hold
their
slaves
in
bondage
and
ignorance
resolved
that
we
object
to
leaving
the
land
of
our
birth
as
there
is
sufficient
land
in
these
united
states
on
which
a
colony
can
be
established
that
would
be
far
more
consonant
to
the
wishes
of
the
colored
population
generally
and
would
be
more
adapted
to
their
constitution
neither
would
it
involve
the
country
in
such
expense
as
would
be
incurred
by
sending
them
to
a
howling
wilderness
far
away
from
the
graves
of
their
forefathers
unknown
to
us
in
every
respect
unless
by
geography
which
few
of
us
understand
resolved
that
this
meeting
look
upon
the
colonization
society
as
a
vicious
nefarious
and
combination
and
that
its
leaders
might
as
well
essay
to
cure
a
wound
with
an
argument
or
set
a
dislocated
bone
by
a
lecture
on
logic
as
to
tell
us
their
object
is
to
better
our
condition
because
its
members
acknowledge
slavery
to
be
a
national
evil
and
use
no
means
to
annihilate
it
but
are
exerting
all
their
energies
and
influence
to
persuade
the
free
people
of
color
to
remove
to
africa
whose
rights
to
columbia
happy
soil
holds
good
with
any
other
citizen
in
america
resolved
that
we
look
upon
the
conduct
of
those
clergymen
who
have
misled
their
respective
congregations
with
the
preposterous
idea
of
the
necessity
of
transporting
the
free
people
of
color
to
africa
as
highly
deserving
the
just
reprehension
directed
to
the
false
priests
and
prophets
by
the
true
prophets
of
the
most
high
yet
we
gratefully
acknowledge
the
respect
we
entertain
for
those
who
have
defended
our
cause
we
mean
our
white
friends
resolved
that
this
meeting
appoint
mr
george
chester
of
harrisburg
as
agent
for
the
liberator
and
will
use
our
utmost
endeavors
to
get
subscribers
for
the
same
resolved
that
we
will
support
the
colony
in
canada
the
climate
being
healthy
and
the
rights
of
our
brethren
secured
resolved
that
the
gratitude
of
this
meeting
which
is
so
sensibly
felt
be
fully
expressed
to
the
editors
of
the
liberator
and
genius
of
universal
emancipation
messrs
garrison
and
lundy
whose
independence
of
mind
and
correct
views
of
the
rights
of
man
have
led
them
so
intrepidly
to
speak
in
favor
of
our
cause
resolved
that
the
proceedings
of
this
meeting
be
signed
by
the

and

from

rochester
october
a
large
number
of
the
colored
citizens
of
rochester
having
convened
themselves
together
for
the
important
object
of
taking
into
consideration
the
principles
of
the
american
colonization
society
the
rev
mr
johnson
was
called
to
the
chair
and
mr
lawrence
was
appointed
secretary
the
meeting
was
then
briefly
addressed
by
the
secretary
as
follows
countrymen
and
brothers
when
viewing
the
inhumanity
and
principles
of
the
american
colonization
society
in
plotting
our
removal
to
africa
which
is
unknown
to
us
as
our
native
country
it
seems
as
though
we
were
called
upon
publicly
to
express
our
feelings
on
the
subject
we
do
not
consider
africa
to
be
our
home
any
more
than
the
present
whites
do
england
scotland
or
ireland
this
is
the
land
our
fathers
have
tilled
before
us
this
is
the
land
that
gave
us
our
the
meeting
then
resolved
that
we
never
will
remove
to
africa
but
should
any
of
our
brethren
wish
to
emigrate
we
would
recommend
canada
as
a
country
far
more
congenial
to
our
constitutions
that
we
give
our
most
sincere
thanks
to
our
friendly
advocates
messrs
garrison
and
knapp
and
mr
benjamin
lundy
who
are
crying
unto
their
fellow
men
night
and
day
to
let
their
countrymen
go
free
they
will
be
called
blessed
by
many
generations
yet
to
come
the
colonization
society
say
that
they
can
not
treat
us
as
men
while
we
are
with
them
but
if
we
will
go
out
of
their
reach
they
will
begin
their
charity
what
should
we
think
of
such
religion
as
this
because
our
skin
is
a
little
darker
than
theirs
they
say
they
can
not
think
of
treating
us
as
men
the
scripture
says
of
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
and
such
they
seem
to
be
we
earnestly
believe
with
our
generous
friend
garrison
that
it
would
not
be
a
hard
matter
to
exceed
them
in
doing
right
our
blessed
lord
said
that
we
should
do
to
all
men
as
we
would
have
them
do
to
us
now
what
would
they
think
if
we
should
tell
them
that
they
would
be
better
off
in
new
holland
or
in
tartary
resolved
that
we
will
do
all
in
our
power
to
support
the
liberator
printed
by
mr
garrison
and
all
other
works
in
our
behalf

of

people
of

duly
appointed
and
publicly
holden
at
the
african
church
on
the
of
october
to
take
into
consideration
the
objects
and
motives
of
the
american
colonization
society
mr
george
willis
was
called
to
the
chair
and
mr
alfred
niger
appointed
secretary
the
meeting
was
then
addressed
at
some
length
by
the
chairman
stating
their
object
in
assembling
together
and
exposing
the
injustice
and
prejudice
by
which
he
believed
the
friends
of
african
colonization
were
actuated
the
following
preamble
and
resolutions
were
read
by
the
secretary
and
unanimously
adopted
whereas
our
brethren
in
different
parts
of
the
united
states
have
thought
proper
to
call
meetings
to
express
their
disapprobation
of
the
american
colonization
society
we
concurring
fully
with
them
in
opinion
have
assembled
ourselves
together
for
the
purpose
of
uniting
with
them
in
declaring
that
we
believe
the
operations
of
the
society
have
been
unchristian
and
and
at
variance
with
our
best
interests
as
a
people
therefore
resolved
that
we
will
use
every
fair
and
honorable
means
in
our
power
to
oppose
the
operations
of
the
above
mentioned
society
resolved
that
we
are
truly
sensible
that
we
are
in
this
country
a
degraded
and
ignorant
people
but
that
our
ignorance
and
degradation
are
not
to
be
attributed
to
the
inferiority
of
our
natural
abilities
but
to
the
oppressive
treatment
we
have
experienced
from
the
whites
in
general
and
to
the
prejudice
excited
against
us
by
the
members
of
the
colonization
society
their
aiders
and
abettors
resolved
that
we
view
with
unfeigned
astonishment
the
and
inconsistent
conduct
of
those
who
so
strenuously
advocate
our
removal
from
this
our
native
country
to
the
burning
shores
of
liberia
and
who
with
the
same
breath
contend
against
the
cruelty
and
injustice
of
georgia
in
her
attempt
to
remove
the
cherokee
indians
west
of
the
mississippi
resolved
that
we
firmly
believe
from
the
recent
measures
adopted
by
the
freemen
of
the
city
of
new
haven
in
regard
to
the
establishment
of
a
college
for
our
education
in
that
place
that
the
principal
object
of
the
friends
of
african
colonization
is
to
oppose
our
education
and
consequent
elevation
here
as
it
will
deprive
them
of
one
of
their
principal
arguments
for
our
removal
resolved
that
as
our
fathers
participated
with
the
whites
in
their
struggle
for
liberty
and
independence
and
believing
with
the
declaration
of
that
independence
all
men
are
created
free
and
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
among
which
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
as
we
have
committed
no
crime
worthy
of
banishment
therefore
resolved
that
we
will
not
leave
our
homes
nor
the
graves
of
our
fathers
and
this
boasted
land
of
liberty
and
christian
philanthropy
resolved
that
our
unfeigned
and
sincere
thanks
be
tendered
to
messrs
garrison
and
knapp
and
to
every
true
friend
to
our
cause
for
their
unwearied
and
truly
benevolent
exertions
in
our
behalf
resolved
that
we
will
earnestly
recommend
the
liberator
published
in
boston
by
the
above
mentioned
gentlemen
to
the
patronage
of
our
friends
throughout
the
country
resolved
that
the
proceedings
of
this
meeting
be
signed
by
the
chairman
and
secretary
and
sent
to

with
the
request
that

for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
subject

on

was
called

and
abner

appointed
secretary
the
meeting
was
addressed
by
messrs
gardener
and
thompson
after
which
the
following
resolutions
were
unanimously
adopted
resolved
inasmuch
as
we
free
people
of
color
have
done
all
that
is
in
our
power
to
convince
the
white
inhabitants
of
these
united
states
that
it
is
our
wish
to
live
peaceably
with
all
men
and
inasmuch
as
our
general
demeanor
has
been
that
of
industry
and
sobriety
notwithstanding
there
are
some
among
us
to
the
contrary
as
well
as
among
the
whites
therefore
we
do
most
solemnly
declare
that
the
statements
made
to
the
contrary
by
the
rev
mr
crosby
in
his
late
addresses
in
this
city
and
all
statements
by
petitioners
to
legislative
bodies
and
by
the
colonization
society
or
any
thing
of
the
same
nature
are
a
positive
libel
on
our
general
character
resolved
whereas
we
have
lived
peaceably
and
quietly
in
these
united
states
of
which
we
are
natives
and
have
never
been
the
cause
of
any
insurrectionary
or
tumultuous
movements
as
a
body
that
we
do
view
every
measure
taken
by
any
associated
bodies
to
remove
us
to
other
climes
and
hostile
to
our
peace
and
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
humanity
resolved
that
if
in
the
opinion
of
government
our
stay
or
liberty
can
no
longer
be
granted
in
the
states
in
which
we
live
we
see
nothing
contrary
to
the
constitution
of
these
united
states
or
to
christianity
justice
reason
or
humanity
in
granting
us
a
portion
of
the
western
territory
as
a
state
with
the
same
franchise
as
that
of
pennsylvania
new
jersey
or
any
other
free
state
for
we
challenge
the
union
to
prove
that
as
free
men
we
have
ever
given
the
least
ground
for
the
uncharitable
censures
that
have
been
cast
upon
us
resolved
that
we
view
the
american
colonization
society
as
the
most
inveterate
foe
both
to
the
free
and
slave
man
of
color
forasmuch
as
the
agents
thereof
and
its
members
who
have
petitioned
the
several
legislatures
have
unequivocally
declared
its
object
to
wit
the
extermination
of
the
free
people
of
color
from
the
union
and
to
effect
this
they
have
not
failed
to
slander
our
character
by
representing
us
as
a
vagrant
race
and
we
do
therefore
disclaim
all
union
with
the
said
society
and
once
for
all
declare
that
we
never
will
remove
under
their
patronage
neither
do
we
consider
it
expedient
to
emigrate
any
where
but
to
remain
in
the
land
and
see
the
salvation
of
god
nevertheless
if
any
of
our
brethren
should
be
compelled
or
see
proper
to
emigrate
we
would
recommend
to
them
upper
canada
or
mexico
resolved
that
we
view
with
the
highest
emotion
of
gratitude
the
benevolence
of
great
britain
and
that
of
the
canada
company
in
affording
an
asylum
in
the
wilberforce
settlement
in
upper
canada
for
our
oppressed
brethren
of
the
south
who
have
been
or
may
be
forced
by
unconstitutional
laws
to
leave
their
rightful
home
and
place
of
nativity
without
any
cause
except
that
of
having
a
dark
skin
resolved
that
this
meeting
approve
the
establishment
of
a
college
as
recommended
by
the
annual
convention
held
in
philadelphia
last
june
and
that
we
give
all
possible
aid
to
that
institution
resolved
that
we
view
the
liberator
edited
by
william
lloyd
garrison
as
a
great
herald
in
the
cause
of
liberty
and
that
we
recommend
to
the
colored
citizens
of
trenton
the
utility
of
subscribing
to
the
above
named
paper
resolved
that
there
be
a
committee
of
three
appointed
to
draft
an
address
more
expressive
of
our
views
on
the
above
subject
resolved
that
the
following
persons
compose
that
committee
sampson
peters
robert
thomas
george
cole
lewis
cork
chairman
abner
francis
secretary
address
we
the
undersigned
in
conformity
to
the
above
appointment
beg
leave
to
present
to
the
public
in
a
calm
unprejudiced
manner
our
decided
disapprobation
of
the
american
colonization
society
and
its
auxiliaries
in
relation
to
the
people
of
color
in
the
united
states
we
are
well
convinced
from
the
mass
that
has
been
written
on
the
above
subject
by
those
who
have
preceded
us
that
it
will
be
difficult
to
avoid
repetition
nevertheless
we
hope
to
touch
some
points
which
have
not
been
fairly
understood
by
that
society
they
have
supposed
that
our
objections
are
to
civilizing
and
evangelizing
africa
but
we
beg
leave
to
say
that
it
is
an
error
we
are
well
aware
that
there
is
no
surer
way
to
effect
this
great
object
than
to
plant
among
the
heathen
colonies
of
christian
missionaries
we
wish
therefore
to
be
understood
that
we
highly
approve
of
the
evangelizing
of
africa
but
disapprove
of
the
present
measures
of
the
american
colonization
society
if
their
motives
have
not
been
misrepresented
by
their
agents
and
others
in
some
previous
addresses
in
this
city
and
elsewhere
but
viewing
them
as
we
now
do
we
must
say
that
in
our
opinion
their
false
representations
of
our
general
character
their
recommending
our
removal
from
our
native
land
their
opposition
to
our
having
a
part
of
the
west
appointed
to
us
their
objections
to
our
proposed
college
and
of
our
march
to
science
their
false
statements
in
relation
to
the
health
of
the
colony
at
liberia
with
a
variety
of
other
subjects
of
the
same
nature
all
lead
to
a
conclusion
that
it
is
our
greatest
foe
we
would
here
ask
the
public
a
few
questions
first
is
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
calculated
to
lead
to
insurrectionary
measures
if
so
why
then
send
it
to
the
heathen
second
what
gentleman
who
has
set
his
slaves
free
has
been
murdered
by
them
for
so
doing
third
what
have
those
states
who
have
washed
their
hands
clean
of
the
cursed
stain
of
slavery
lost
by
it
fourth
what
neighborhood
where
education
and
general
information
have
been
disseminated
among
the
people
of
color
is
the
worse
for
it
in
closing
our
remarks
we
would
say
that
we
do
think
that
the
subjects
looked
to
by
the
colonization
society
to
civilize
africa
are
incompetent
for
we
do
suppose
that
men
selected
for
such
an
important
enterprise
should
be
men
of
deed
and
sound
piety
men
of
regular
and
industrious
habits
of
scientific
knowledge
and
general
experience
that
such
men
can
be
obtained
we
have
no
doubt
and
if
there
can
not
let
us
first
prepare
some
in
this
country
sampson

a
voice
from
lyme
lyme
january
at
a
respectable
meeting
of
the
colored
citizens
of
this
place
held
pursuant
to
public
notice
mr
luther
wright
was
called
to
the
chair
and
mr
daniel
condol
appointed
secretary
after
some
animated
remarks
by
messrs
wright
and
condol
it
was
resolved
that
it
is
the
sincere
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
the
american
colonization
society
is
one
of
the
wildest
projects
ever
patronised
by
a
body
of
enlightened
men
and
further
that
many
of
those
who
support
it
would
be
willing

resolved
that
though

be
last
in
calling
a

we
feel
no
less
the
pernicious
influence
of
this
society

rest
of
our
brethren
and
that
we
will
resist
every
attempt
to
banish
us
from
this
our
native
land
resolved

we
place
unshaken
reliance
upon
the
promises

give
freedom
to

we
the
undersigned
in
conformity
to
the
above
appointment
beg
leave
to
present
to
the
public
in
a
calm
and
unprejudiced
manner
our
reasons
for
opposing
the
scheme
of
african
colonization
this
is
the
land
of
our
birth
the
declaration
of
independence
declares
that
men
are
born
free
and
equal
it
does
not
say
that
the
man
or
the
man
is
free
but
all
without
respect
to
color
tongues
or
nation
we
therefore
consider
all
laws
to
enslave
or
degrade
the
people
of
color
as
contrary
to
the
letter
and
spirit
of
this
declaration
and
that
according
to
it
we
are
freemen
and
have
as
indisputable
a
right
to
enjoy
our
liberty
as
any
white
man
to
deny
it
to
us
because
we
differ
in
color
is
oppression
to
say
that
africa
is
our
native
country
is
untrue
here
we
were
born
and
here
we
mean
to
die
for
all
men
are
born
free
we
wish
to
return
our
grateful
thanks
to
our
friends
and
to
the
friends
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
we
consider
slavery
a
national
sin
which
if
not
speedily
overthrown
will
cause
this
nation
to
mourn
and
weep
for
god
has
declared
that
ethiopia
shall
stretch
forth
her
hands
unto
him
and
he
will
hear
her
cry
we
would
say
to
colonizationists
that
we
consider
them
our
foes
instead
of
our
friends
it
is
vain
for
them
to
say
that
we
would
do
better
in
liberia
for
we
do
not
believe
it
there
is
room
enough
in
this
country
for
us
and
if
they
be
our
friends
let
them
meliorate
our
condition
here
let
them
join
in
the
work
of
immediate
abolition
of
slavery
let
them
wash
out
the
stains
which
disfigure
the
national
character
and
then
let
them
tell
us
about
liberia
one
reason
why
we
are
opposed
to
leaving
these
united
states
is
this
you
have
so
long
denied
us
the
enjoyment
and
protection
of
the
laws
of
god
and
man
in
this
country
that
you
wish
now
to
oppress
us
still
more
but
thanks
be
to
him
who
holds
all
things
in
his
hand
we
believe
he
will
plead
our
cause
your
skirts
are
already
dyed
with
the
blood
of
millions
of
souls
is
mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
lord
awake
ye
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
your
cup
is
now
full
you
are
daily
causing
innocent
blood
to
be
shed
how
long
ye
slavites
ye
kidnappers
ye
that
traffic
in
human
flesh
will
you
sleep
when
will
you
awake
to
your
best
interests
for
remember
that
you
will
not
always
be
able
to
hold
your
victims
in
servile
chains

a
voice
from
january
at
a
meeting
of
the
people
of
color
in
january
for
the
purpose
of
considering
and
giving
their
opinion
of
the
american
colonization
society
and
the
actual
evil
or
benefit
of
that
society
to
the
objects
of
its
supervision
the
free
people
of
color
mr
richard
johnson
was
called
to
the
chair
and
richard
overing
appointed
secretary
after
an
address
from
the
chair
it
was
moved
that
resolutions
expressive
of
the
views
of
the
meeting
respecting
the
colonization
society
be
drawn
up
and
published
in
some
newspaper
not
adverse
to
the
rights
and
well
being
of
all
men
be
their
color
what
it
may
the
following
are
the
resolves
of
the
meeting
resolved
that
in
whatever
light
we
view
the
colonization
society
we
discover
nothing
in
it
but
terror
prejudice
and
oppression
that
the
warm
and
beneficent
hand
of
philanthropy
is
not
apparent
in
the
system
but
the
influence
of
the
society
on
public
opinion
is
more
prejudicial
to
the
interest
and
welfare
of
the
people
of
color
in
the
united
states
than
slavery
itself
resolved
that
the
society
to
effect
its
purpose
the
removal
of
the
free
people
of
color
not
the
slaves
through
its
agents
teaches
the
public
to
believe
that
it
is
patriotic
and
benevolent
to
withhold
from
us
knowledge
and
the
means
of
acquiring
subsistence
and
to
look
upon
us
as
unnatural
and
illegal
residents
in
this
country
and
thus
by
force
of
prejudice
if
not
by
law
endeavor
to
compel
us
to
embark
for
africa
and
that
too
apparently
by
our
own
free
will
and
consent
resolved
that
as
great
a
nuisance
as
we
may
be
in
the
estimation
of
that
society
we
yet
have
a
hope
in
him
who
has
seen
fit
to
continue
our
existence
through
days
worse
than
which
we
do
not
fear
and
which
emboldens
us
as
peaceable
citizens
to
resolve
to
abide
the
issue
of
coming
days
in
our
native
land
in
which
we
ask
no
more
than
the
age
in
which
we
live
demands
and
which
this
nation
as
republicans
and
christians
should
not
refuse
to
grant
signed
in
behalf
of
the
meeting
richard
johnson
chairman
overing
secretary
the
foregoing
resolutions
and
addresses
are
given
in
plain
it
may
be
occasionally
in
severe
language
and
display
an
intensity
of
feeling
a
depth
of
abhorrence
and
a
firmness
of
purpose
honorable
to
men
who
appreciate
their
rights
and
love
their
country
before
i
proceed
however
to
comment
upon
these
important
proceedings
i
shall
make
some
quotations
from
the
essays
and
addresses
of
colored
writers
in
order
to
sustain
my
assertion
that
the
american
colonization
society
is
directly
opposed
to
the
wishes
of
our
free
colored
population
colored
baltimorean
ah
records
his
sentiments
in
the
following
style
believe
sirs
that
the
people
of
color
in
the
united
states
will
never
be
prevailed
over
to
abandon
the
land
of
their
birth
and
every
thing
vernacular
with
them
to
forego
many
advantages
which
they
now
possess
and
many
more
which
they
have
in
prospect
for
the
imaginary
or
if
real
the
fleeting
and
honors
held
out
to
them
by
our
empire
why
should
we
exchange
a
temperate
and
salubrious
climate
adapted
to
our
constitutions
as
americans
for
one
to
us
fraught
with
disease
and
death
why
should
we
leave
a
land
in
which
the
arts
and
sciences
are
flourishing
and
which
is
beginning
to
yield
to
our
research
for
one
where
the
irradiating
beams
of
the
sun
of
science
have
yet
to
be
announced
by
the
bright
star
of
hope
why
should
we
leave
a
land
illuminated
with
the
blaze
of
gospel
light
for
one
enshrouded
in
pagan
gloom
why
should
we
who
are
in
tolerable
circumstances
in
america
who
enjoy
many
of
the
comforts
of
life
and
are
evidently
on
the
advanced
march
of
mind
cast
away
these
certain
real
and
growing
advantages
for
those
which
are
precarious
and
chimerical
why
should
we
abandon
our
firesides
and
every
thing
associated
with
the
dear
name
of
undergo
the
fatigues
of
a
perilous
voyage
and
expose
ourselves
our
wives
and
our
little
ones
to
the
deleterious
influences
of
an
uncongenial
sun
for
the
enjoyment
of
a
liberty
divested
of
its
usual
accompaniments
surrounded
with
circumstances
which
diminish
its
intrinsic
value
and
render
it
indeed
a
dear
earned
morsel
it
is
the
hope
of
accomplishing
the
entire
subversion
of
the
slave
trade
and
mahometan
superstition
and
all
their
subsidiary
concomitants
that
has
actuated
the
christian
and
stimulated
the
philanthropist
noble
objects
indeed
and
who
are
those
christians
and
philanthropists
our
friend
tells
us
without
distinction
that
they
are
those
noble
and
heroic
men
who
have
enlisted
under
the
banner
of
colonization
but
how
happens
it
that
some
of
the
most
distinguished
of
these
and
are
themselves
slaveholders
and
so
far
abettors
of
the
as
to
be
actually
guilty
of
selling
into
a
cruel
and
interminable
vassalage
the
hapless
victims
of
their
tender
mercies
again
how
is
it
that
none
but
the
free
people
of
color
have
been
chosen
to
evangelize
africa
is
it
because
they
are
under
an
exclusive
moral
obligation
to
dispel
the
gloom
of
mahometan
superstition
is
it
because
they
are
qualified
in
point
of
morals
and
information
for
the
missionary
enterprise
none
will
say
this
perhaps
we
shall
be
told
that
the
identity
of
their
color
gives
them
a
decided
advantage
over
every
other
people
but
how
is
it
that
those
wicked
white
men
who
are
in
the
habit
of
resorting
thither
for
the
most
nefarious
purposes
have
access
to
these
people
and
we
have
not
forgotten
that
during
the
visit
of
the
rev
mcgill
in
baltimore
he
informed
us
that
colored
men
from
the
united
states
being
thought
by
the
natives
to
be
men
of
information
are
received
and
treated
as
white
men
and
denominated
by
the
same
epithet
since
then
it
does
not
appear
that
we
are
qualified
for
this
work
why
should
it
be
pressed
upon
us
us
not
that
the
sovereign
ruler
of
the
universe
who
is
not
a
respecter
of
persons
whose
tender
mercies
are
over
all
his
works
will
elevate
us
to
the
dignity
of
men
and
christians
unless
we
emigrate
to
africa
tell
us
not
that
in
this
country
this
land
of
the
free
and
home
of
the
brave
we
must
remain
a
degraded
and
proscribed
race
that
we
must
be
treated
as
the
outcasts
of
creation
we
are
aware
that
this
doctrine
has
been
asserted
with
all
the
confidence
of
inspiration
by
of
our
gospel
ministers
we
have
heard
them
proclaim
it
in
a
tone
calculated
to
strengthen
the
prejudices
existing
against
us
they
seem
to
forget
that
there
is
a
superintending
providence
that
he
who
sits
upon
the
whirlwind
and
directs
the
storm
has
ever
manifested
himself
a
friend
to
the
oppressed
of
every
clime
they
seem
to
forget
that
the
religion
of
jesus
wherever
it
reigns
with
unrestrained
sway
demolishes
every
partition
wall
and
exterminates
out
of
the
heart
all
those
bitter
prejudices
which
impede
the
march
of
the
messiah
kingdom
we
should
like
to
have
these
prophets
give
us
their
ideas
in
relation
to
the
millennial
reign
of
christ
we
should
like
to
have
them
inform
us
whether
or
not
the
general
prejudices
and
their
inseparable
accompaniments
which
now
lie
upon
and
operate
against
us
on
account
of
our
color
will
be
consistent
with
this
glorious
reign
of
and
and
let
these
ministers
consider
that
much
of
our
degradation
is
chargeable
to
the
indifference
to
say
the
least
that
they
manifest
in
regard
to
our
situation
that
if
they
as
patterns
of
piety
hold
us
at
a
distance
it
is
but
natural
for
the
inconsiderate
to
follow
their
example
let
them
recollect
that
while
they
are
making
powerful
and
irresistible
appeals
to
the
humanity
of
the
american
people
in
behalf
of
the
oppressed
of
other
climes
they
have
a
people
among
them
whose
claims
upon
their
liberality
are
paramount
to
those
of
any
other
let
these
ministers
tell
us
how
often
they
make
it
their
business
to
visit
those
portions
of
their
flocks
whose
crime
is
their
color
nay
one
of
them
said
not
long
since
to
be
familiar
with
the
people
of
color
would
destroy
his
among
the
whites
but
whether
they
do
their
duty
in
relation
to
us
or
not
we
indulge
in
no
fears
in
regard
to
our
future
condition
we
are
not
distrustful
of
the
goodness
and
power
of
him
who
has
overruled
the
evil
designs
of
those
men
that
first
tore
our
ancestors
from
their
native
shores
who
is
still
overruling
and
who
will
continue
to
overrule
the
designs
of
all
who
would
treat
us
as
the
offscouring
of
the
earth
because
our
creator
has
not
given
us
a
color
as
white
as
their
own
if
ever
there
was
a
people
who
could
look
up
to
heaven
with
unshaken
confidence
for
protection
it
is
that
people
whose
sufferings
are
not
the
consequences
of
their
crimes
it
is
that
people
whose
misfortunes
work
in
them
the
graces
of
faith
patience
and
hope
and
why
should
we
not
cherish
these
invaluable
graces
we
are
told
by
high
authority
that
shall
work
together
to
them
that
love
god
that
he
will
give
grace
and
glory
and
good
will
he
from
them
that
walk
uprightly
you
see
sirs
we
have
one
straight
forward
course
to
pursue
one
marked
out
by
the
hand
of
unerring
wisdom
this
course
we
intend
to
pursue
without
giving
ourselves
any
uneasiness
as
to
the
issue
this
we
leave
to
him
who
has
the
administration
of
the
universe
in
his
hands
and
who
has
declared
for
our
encouragement
even
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered
tell
us
not
of
the
wisdom
and
power
and
number
of
our
enemies
he
who
has
given
us
a
hope
which
at
least
makes
our
condition
tolerable
will
say
to
them
as
he
did
to
the
tempestuous
billows
hitherto
shalt
thou
come
but
no
further
and
here
shall
thy
proud
waves
be
stayed
effect
have
the
evils
of
slavery
in
this
land
upon
the
mind
of
the
liberal
the
unprejudiced
and
philanthropic
lafayette
him
he
will
speak
for
himself
when
i
am
indulging
in
my
views
of
american
prospects
and
american
liberty
it
is
mortifying
to
be
told
that
in
that
very
country
a
large
portion
of
the
people
are
slaves
it
is
a
dark
spot
on
the
face
of
the
nation
a
state
of
things
can
not
always
it
was
a
sight
of
the
evils
alluded
to
and
their
inseparable
concomitants
that
extorted
from
the
pen
of
mr
jefferson
that
comprehensive
and
sentence
i
tremble
for
my
country
when
i
reflect
that
god
is
just
and
that
his
justice
can
not
sleep
for
ever
but
may
we
not
indulge
the
hope
that
the
evils
spoken
of
will
yet
awaken
the
sympathies
of
the
american
people
soften
their
cruel
prejudices
arouse
their
slumbering
energies
and
produce
in
them
an
unconquerable
determination
to
wash
from
their
stars
and
stripes
one
of
the
blackest
spots
that
ever
cursed
the
globe
or
stained
the
historic
page
shall
we
be
told
that
prejudices
render
this
great
desideratum
impracticable
and
what
is
this
but
a
libel
upon
the
american
people
what
is
it
but
to
say
there
is
in
them
a
moral
incapacity
to
do
justice
love
mercy
and
walk
uprightly
colonization
orators
designing
politicians
ministers
of
jesus
tell
me
how
can
you
thus
libel
your
countrymen
surely
there
is
a
regenerating
a
redeeming
spirit
in
the
land
a
spirit
transforming
misanthropes
into
philanthropists
bondmen
into
freemen
abettors
of
slavery
into
champions
of
liberty
a
spirit
that
will
yet
drive
from
america
the
demon
of
slavery
and
render
it
indeed
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
ai
have
just
found
time
to
notice
a
few
very
exceptionable
features
of
a
communication
over
the
signature
of
a
marylander
published
a
few
days
ago
in
the
american
of
our
city
the
writer
is
unquestionably
entitled
to
the
credit
of
being
a
colonizationist
he
writes
in
the
of
the
cause
he
seems
to
be
under
an
excitement
produced
by
the
publication
of
our
resolutions
this
being
the
case
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
would
throughout
his
communication
avail
himself
of
the
guarded
accommodating
and
conciliating
language
usual
with
colonization
writers
and
declaimers
after
being
convinced
that
the
people
of
color
are
not
to
be
persuaded
to
leave
the
land
of
their
birth
and
every
thing
vernacular
with
them
for
regions
which
he
tells
us
are
now
dark
as
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
he
says
i
would
propose
then
that
maryland
should
colonize
her
own
free
blacks
he
does
not
add
the
usual
qualification
their
own
he
knows
this
will
never
be
obtained
he
therefore
says
i
earnestly
that
the
time
come
when
our
state
will
wake
up
to
all
the
importance
of
this
subject
and
will
instantly
commence
system
of
imperatively
demanded
by
the
principles
colonization
principles
of
policy
we
would
tell
this
precocious
statesman
that
we
are
not
to
be
intimidated
into
colonization
by
the
angry
effusions
of
his
illiberal
soul
that
we
had
rather
die
in
maryland
under
the
pressure
of
unrighteous
and
cruel
laws
than
be
driven
like
cattle
to
the
pestilential
clime
of
liberia
where
grievous
privation
inevitable
disease
and
premature
death
await
us
in
all
their
horrors
we
are
emboldened
thus
to
speak
not
from
a
reliance
on
the
mere
arm
of
flesh
no
it
is
the
righteousness
of
our
cause
a
knowledge
of
the
attributes
of
deity
combined
with
a
consciousness
of
innocence
under
suffering
that
have
inspired
us
with
a
moral
courage
which
no
oppression
shall
shake
no
fulminations
overawe
our
limits
will
not
permit
us
to
expatiate
at
this
time
on
the
import
of
the
terms
system
of
measures
the
sternest
we
would
barely
remark
that
the
climax
of
injustice
and
cruelty
here
suggested
nay
recommended
is
the
legitimate
fruit
of
the
operations
of
the
american
colonization
societies
relative
to
the
free
people
of
color
we
have
always
believed
that
the
of
here
recommended
would
be
the
dernier
resort
of
these
associations
the
unmerited
abuse
that
has
been
so
unsparingly
heaped
upon
us
by
colonizationists
for
expressing
our
opinions
of
their
project
as
connected
with
our
happiness
their
manifest
determination
to
effectuate
their
object
regardless
of
our
consent
abundantly
corroborate
the
opinion
we
have
long
since
entertained
we
turn
however
from
the
contemplation
of
the
persecution
and
oppression
which
it
seems
are
in
reserve
for
us
to
notice
briefly
the
moving
cause
of
this
virulent
and
relentless
attack
upon
our
rights
and
happiness
the
just
says
a
marylander
us
in
the
strongest
manner
of
the
necessity
of
prompt
and
efficient
measures
to
drain
off
this
description
of
our
population
here
then
is
the
the
the
principle
by
which
the
colonization
societies
throughout
our
land
are
actuated
this
is
the
selfish
policy
of
which
we
complain
and
which
should
be
execrated
by
all
patriots
philanthropists
and
christians
our
increase
is
represented
as
an
evil
an
said
one
of
our
colonization
orators
in
the
pulpit
not
long
since
which
our
very
now
if
all
this
be
true
how
can
they
on
their
own
principles
say
we
can
be
a
people
in
this
country
surely
they
are
taking
effectual
steps
to
convince
us
that
the
enjoyment
of
our
rights
in
this
our
native
land
is
not
only
possible
but
highly
probable
this
we
have
always
believed
and
we
hope
and
pray
that
it
may
be
accomplished
in
a
way
sanctioned
by
the
gospel
of
peace
without
confused
noise
or
garments
rolled
in
blood
but
this
glorious
victory
over
pride
and
prejudice
by
gospel
weapons
will
never
be
accomplished
by
colonization
principles
nor
will
those
ministers
of
the
gospel
have
any
part
or
lot
in
this
matter
who
solemnly
declare
in
the
face
of
heaven
and
earth
that
we
can
enjoy
in
this
those
inalienable
rights
of
man
whose
inviolable
preservation
promotes
the
welfare
of
the
whole
human
family
such
ministers
virtually
declare
that
they
do
not
believe
the
doctrines
they
are
bound
to
preach
that
he
from
whom
they
profess
to
have
received
their
commission
is
indeed
a
hard
man
reaping
where
he
has
not
sown
and
gathering
where
he
has
not
strawed
that
he
requires
of
them
and
their
flocks
that
which
they
are
morally
incapable
of
performing
that
they
love
their
neighbor
as
themselves
or
do
unto
others
what
they
wish
done
unto
themselves
because
their
lord
in
his
wisdom
has
given
some
of
their
fellow
creatures
a
different
color
from
their
own
these
temporising
retrograde
reformers
are
doing
a
serious
injury
to
the
people
of
color
they
heed
not
the
warning
of
heaven
do
my
people
no
harm
they
are
doing
more
to
strengthen
the
cruel
and
unchristian
prejudices
already
too
powerful
against
us
than
all
the
slaveholders
in
the
union
they
hesitate
not
to
declare
that
in
america
we
are
out
of
the
reach
of
humanity
they
seem
to
think
that
the
religion
of
the
benevolent
saviour
which
enjoins
all
and
which
explicitly
says
if
ye
have
to
ye
is
nothing
more
than
a
dead
letter
or
must
remain
powerless
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
have
these
men
the
face
to
contend
with
the
infidels
of
our
land
why
one
infidel
with
the
bible
in
his
hands
would
chase
a
thousand
and
two
put
ten
thousand
to
flight
but
notwithstanding
these
discouraging
circumstances
our
cause
will
yet
triumph
he
who
is
for
us
is
stronger
than
all
that
are
against
us
the
rulers
of
the
land
may
take
counsel
together
and
some
of
the
professed
ministers
of
jesus
may
come
into
their
secret
but
he
that
sitteth
in
the
heavens
shall
laugh
the
lord
shall
have
them
in
derision
fear
not
then
my
colored
countrymen
but
press
forward
with
a
laudable
ambition
for
all
that
heaven
has
intended
for
you
and
your
children
remembering
that
the
path
of
duty
is
the
path
of
safety
and
that
righteousness
alone
exalteth
a
nation
if
excellence
of
style
a
dignified
carriage
sound
logic
a
high
and
abiding
faith
and
fervent
piety
confer
credit
upon
a
writer
few
have
ever
better
illustrated
these
traits
than
colored
baltimorean
or
deserved
a
nobler
tribute
of
praise
he
who
would
be
ashamed
to
acknowledge
such
a
man
as
his
countryman
and
brother
has
yet
to
learn
his
own
insignificance
and
what
constitutes
the
majesty
of
human
nature
the
following
is
an
extract
of
a
letter
from
a
colored
gentleman
of
wealth
and
respectability
in
philadelphia
whose
friendship
is
courted
by
honorable
men
and
whose
usefulness
is
scarcely
exceeded
by
any
other
citizen
it
not
preposterous
to
one
like
myself
whose
family
has
resided
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
ever
since
the
great
lawgiver
william
penn
came
last
to
this
state
from
england
and
who
fought
for
the
independence
of
my
country
whose
declaration
asserts
that
all
men
are
born
with
free
and
equal
rights
is
it
not
preposterous
to
be
told
that
this
is
not
my
country
i
was
seven
months
on
board
of
the
old
jersey
prison
ship
in
the
year
the
times
that
tried
men
souls
and
am
i
now
to
be
told
that
africa
is
my
country
by
some
of
those
whose
is
unknown
is
it
not
a
contradiction
to
say
that
a
man
is
an
alien
to
the
country
in
which
he
was
born
to
separate
the
blacks
from
the
whites
is
as
impossible
as
to
bale
out
the
delaware
with
a
bucket
i
have
always
been
decidedly
of
opinion
that
if
the
colonization
society
would
take
but
half
the
pains
to
improve
the
children
of
color
in
their
own
country
and
expend
but
half
the
money
that
they
are
devoting
to
accomplish
their
visionary
scheme
of
christianizing
africa
by
offering
premiums
to
master
mechanics
to
take
them
as
apprentices
they
would
do
more
to
destroy
prejudice
than
any
thing
else
when
i
look
at
this
globe
containing
eight
or
nine
hundred
millions
of
inhabitants
and
see
that
they
differ
in
color
from
the
frozen
to
the
temperate
and
torrid
zones
and
that
every
thing
is
variegated
i
am
astonished
that
any
man
should
be
so
prejudiced
against
his
but
we
pray
for
the
aid
of
the
almighty
to
take
the
scales
from
their
eyes
and
that
the
liberator
may
be
one
of
the
instruments
in
commencing
the
work
aj
would
ask
some
of
our
pretended
white
friends
and
the
members
of
the
american
colonization
society
why
they
are
so
interested
in
our
behalf
as
to
want
us
to
go
to
africa
they
tell
us
that
it
is
our
home
that
they
desire
to
make
a
people
of
us
which
we
can
never
be
here
that
they
want
africa
civilized
and
that
we
are
the
very
persons
to
do
it
as
it
is
almost
impossible
for
any
white
person
to
exist
there
i
deny
it
will
some
of
those
guardian
angels
of
the
people
of
color
tell
me
how
it
is
that
we
who
were
born
in
the
same
city
or
state
with
themselves
can
live
any
longer
in
africa
than
they
i
consider
it
the
most
absurd
assertion
that
any
man
of
common
sense
could
make
unless
it
is
supposed
as
some
have
already
said
that
we
are
void
of
understanding
if
we
had
been
born
on
that
continent
the
transportation
would
be
another
matter
but
as
the
fact
is
the
reverse
we
consider
the
united
states
our
home
and
not
africa
as
they
wish
to
make
us
believe
and
if
we
do
emigrate
it
will
be
to
a
place
of
our
own
choice
would
also
mention
to
the
supporters
of
the
colonization
society
that
if
they
would
spend
half
the
time
and
money
that
they
do
in
educating
the
colored
population
and
giving
them
lands
to
cultivate
here
and
secure
to
them
all
the
rights
and
immunities
of
freemen
instead
of
sending
them
to
africa
it
would
be
found
in
a
short
time
that
they
made
as
good
citizens
as
the
whites
their
traducers
would
hear
of
fewer
murders
highway
robberies
forgeries
being
committed
than
they
do
at
present
among
some
of
the
white
inhabitants
of
this
country
ak
principles
abstractly
considered
are
unobjectionable
but
the
means
employed
for
their
propagation
we
think
are
altogether
objectionable
we
are
deprived
of
our
birthright
and
pointed
by
the
colonization
partisans
to
another
country
as
a
home
they
speak
of
the
prejudices
which
exist
against
us
as
an
insuperable
hindrance
to
the
improvement
of
our
situation
here
we
are
sickened
by
the
constant
reiteration
of
which
tends
immediately
to
justify
the
slaveholder
in
his
crime
and
increase
already
existing
prejudice
the
colonization
society
never
will
effect
the
removal
of
slavery
the
god
of
justice
will
never
in
my
opinion
let
this
nation
off
so
easily
it
is
in
vain
to
hold
back
the
eyes
of
all
will
ultimately
be
opened
to
see
that
nothing
but
universal
emancipation
can
possibly
avert
impending
wrath
al
long
oh
ye
boasters
of
freedom
will
ye
endeavor
to
persuade
us
your
derided
degraded
fellow
countrymen
to
the
belief
that
our
interest
and
happiness
are
prized
in
high
estimation
among
you
be
it
known
that
we
are
not
all
such
misguided
deluded
mortals
as
to
be
duped
by
your
plans
that
we
will
not
suffer
ourselves
to
become
so
infatuated
as
to
hurl
reason
from
her
throne
and
succumb
to
your
glittering
showy
path
to
eminence
we
spurn
with
contempt
your
unrighteous
schemes
and
point
the
finger
of
derision
at
your
fruitless
attempts
you
have
commenced
them
in
a
day
when
liberty
justice
and
equality
are
claimed
by
almost
all
as
nature
rights
for
behold
a
beam
of
science
lucid
as
the
sun
has
divinely
fallen
upon
the
lightless
intellects
of
a
portion
of
that
ignoble
part
of
your
fellow
creatures
who
have
been
so
long
the
victims
of
your
fell
injustice
and
inhumanity
would
to
god
that
conscience
might
subdue
your
malignant
prejudices
tell
us
not
that
our
condition
can
never
be
bettered
in
the
land
of
our
birth
you
know
it
not
make
but
the
attempt
in
consecrating
a
portion
of
your
time
talents
and
money
upon
us
here
and
you
would
soon
find
the
cause
of
afric
injured
race
vindicated
by
her
descendants
and
the
day
which
now
dawns
would
be
speedily
ushered
into
blazing
light
declaring
in
its
effulgence
the
joyful
sound
of
liberty
justice
equality
to
all
mankind
am
is
much
to
be
surprised
at
little
to
admire
and
nothing
worthy
of
imitation
in
the
bubbles
of
our
friends
the
colonizationists
they
have
enlisted
the
prejudices
and
the
support
of
the
wealthy
and
influential
in
their
favor
they
have
succeeded
in
sending
some
two
or
three
thousand
to
liberia
and
they
are
flattered
with
their
partial
success
and
no
doubt
look
forward
to
the
time
when
they
will
behold
the
whole
of
the
colored
inhabitants
of
america
in
the
far
distant
land
of
africa
but
let
them
not
anticipate
too
much
they
have
yet
one
obstacle
to
overcome
which
threatens
to
overthrow
their
baseless
fabric
or
at
any
rate
impede
their
progress
their
proceedings
have
not
obtained
the
approbation
of
those
whose
approbation
is
most
needed
colored
people
they
are
most
strangely
mistaken
if
they
suppose
that
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
win
them
either
by
or
the
press
has
begun
its
revolutionizing
work
overturning
in
its
progress
every
thing
calculated
to
suppress
inquiry
or
to
blind
the
understanding
already
have
the
intrigues
of
the
designing
been
exposed
and
already
have
the
colored
people
set
their
faces
against
oppression
colonization
society
has
erred
in
matters
of
for
instead
of
exerting
themselves
to
gain
the
confidence
of
the
colored
people
and
thus
by
persuasion
to
have
rid
the
country
of
them
they
have
acted
in
a
manner
calculated
to
disgust
every
humane
mind
and
have
rendered
it
an
utter
to
remove
them
and
it
is
most
fortunate
for
the
unfortunate
that
they
have
detected
those
intriguing
spirits
in
their
and
undertaking
many
hours
of
anguish
how
much
incalculable
misery
has
been
prevented
in
short
how
many
human
beings
have
been
saved
from
an
untimely
grave
by
the
timely
interposition
of
the
press
it
has
said
let
it
be
so
and
it
so
its
thunders
have
been
heard
and
the
oppressor
trembles
like
the
earthquake
it
has
overthrown
yea
totally
demolished
the
sword
of
the
colonization
society
the
press
then
ye
people
of
color
and
the
result
will
be
a
total
overthrow
of
all
the
darling
schemes
of
the
aforesaid
darling
society
it
has
accomplished
wonders
yea
wonders
already
much
more
can
nay
will
be
done
again
i
say
support
the
press
an
african
colonization
society
declares
that
we
the
people
of
color
shall
have
no
part
nor
lot
in
the
free
institutions
of
this
country
why
because
the
creator
of
all
the
sovereign
ruler
of
the
universe
who
holds
in
his
hands
the
destiny
of
nations
thought
fit
and
proper
in
his
infinite
wisdom
to
tincture
us
with
a
darker
hue
than
the
paler
part
of
community
or
if
i
may
say
because
the
lot
of
our
predecessors
happened
to
be
cast
in
the
torrid
zone
beneath
the
scorching
beams
of
a
vertical
sun
these
are
the
objections
the
african
colonization
society
offer
to
this
community
to
our
remaining
in
this
country
in
the
land
of
freemen
these
are
the
considerations
that
prompt
them
to
tell
us
that
we
the
descendants
of
africa
can
never
be
men
unless
we
abandon
the
land
of
our
birth
our
homes
and
people
and
submit
to
that
uncongenial
clime
the
barbarous
regions
of
africa
amidst
unyielding
contagion
and
mortality
o
that
man
would
remember
that
knowledge
and
virtue
not
complexion
are
the
emblems
that
constitute
the
value
of
human
dignity
with
these
we
are
worthy
without
them
we
are
unworthy
by
the
acts
and
operations
of
wicked
men
shielded
under
a
cloak
of
religion
we
the
people
of
color
are
doomed
to
all
the
miseries
that
the
human
body
is
able
to
sustain
deprived
of
light
knowledge
and
social
intercourse
by
the
colonization
gentlemen
with
all
their
pretended
zeal
and
love
of
liberty
manifested
towards
the
african
race
i
count
them
as
enemies
not
friends
i
do
not
solicit
their
love
nor
regard
their
friendship
i
speak
for
one
i
never
did
and
never
will
court
an
enemy
as
a
friend
knowingly
let
him
be
whom
he
may
let
him
belong
to
church
or
state
i
feel
the
weight
of
their
predominant
power
and
the
finishing
blow
they
are
about
to
strike
thus
we
move
by
them
poor
and
pennyless
despised
and
forsaken
by
all
creeping
through
your
streets
submissively
bowed
down
to
every
foot
whose
skin
is
tinctured
with
a
lighter
hue
than
ours
thus
we
sojourn
in
solitude
not
for
our
crimes
but
color
came
here
for
the
purpose
of
showing
to
this
community
that
the
people
of
color
of
the
united
states
disapprove
of
the
african
colonization
plan
they
do
not
wish
to
emigrate
to
africa
these
six
hundred
or
more
that
the
gentleman
tells
you
are
now
waiting
for
a
passage
to
liberia
are
not
the
free
people
of
color
of
the
united
states
they
are
if
any
the
poor
old
southern
slaves
freed
on
the
condition
to
go
to
africa
or
die
in
the
tracks
of
slavery
no
more
fit
for
their
cotton
and
rice
fields
for
the
laws
of
those
states
forbid
the
master
let
him
be
possessed
of
all
the
fine
feelings
that
the
human
mind
is
able
to
contain
unless
he
banishes
them
to
some
distant
region
across
that
mighty
ocean
they
speak
of
they
can
not
be
free
according
to
the
laws
of
those
states
and
the
basis
on
which
the
society
is
built
the
emancipated
slaves
are
not
free
until
they
stand
upon
the
shores
of
liberia
thus
the
northern
and
middle
states
are
called
upon
for
donations
to
enable
the
monarch
of
the
south
to
bury
his
slaves
in
the
sands
of
africa
thus
far
northern
capital
is
instrumental
in
parting
asunder
parents
and
children
no
more
to
meet
until
jehovah
will
stand
upon
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
and
proclaim
deliverance
to
the
captive
when
the
arm
of
tyrants
shall
cease
to
sway
the
rod
of
tyranny
over
the
heads
of
their
helpless
children
until
all
creation
shall
vanish
and
crumble
into
nothing
the
time
of
the
formation
of
this
society
the
people
of
color
in
different
sections
of
the
union
took
the
alarm
they
thought
there
was
something
wrong
in
the
views
of
that
combined
body
so
the
free
people
of
color
of
richmond
convened
themselves
together
in
the
state
of
virginia
where
the
gentleman
says
the
african
colonization
society
first
originated
they
assembled
themselves
together
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
each
other
feelings
with
regard
to
that
combined
body
and
after
mature
reflection
they
petitioned
congress
i
will
give
you
the
words
of
their
memorial
which
are
sufficient
evidence
to
substantiate
in
the
mind
of
every
rational
person
that
the
people
of
color
wish
to
remain
in
this
country
at
a
meeting
of
a
respectable
portion
of
the
free
people
of
color
of
the
city
of
richmond
on
friday
january
william
bowler
was
appointed
chairman
and
lentey
craw
secretary
the
following
preamble
and
resolution
were
read
unanimously
adopted
and
ordered
to
be
printed
whereas
a
society
has
been
formed
at
the
seat
of
government
for
the
purpose
of
colonizing
with
their
own
consent
the
free
people
of
color
of
the
united
states
therefore
we
the
free
people
of
color
of
the
city
of
richmond
have
thought
it
advisable
to
assemble
together
under
the
sanction
of
authority
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
public
expression
of
our
sentiments
on
a
question
in
which
we
are
so
deeply
interested
we
perfectly
agree
with
the
society
that
it
is
not
only
proper
but
would
ultimately
tend
to
the
benefit
and
advantage
of
a
great
portion
of
our
suffering
fellow
creatures
to
be
colonized
but
while
we
thus
express
our
approbation
of
a
measure
laudable
in
its
purposes
and
beneficial
in
its
designs
it
may
not
be
improper
in
us
to
say
that
we
prefer
being
colonized
in
the
most
remote
corner
of
the
land
of
our
nativity
to
being
exiled
to
a
foreign
country
and
whereas
the
president
and
board
of
managers
of
the
said
society
have
been
pleased
to
leave
it
to
the
entire
discretion
of
congress
to
provide
a
suitable
place
for
carrying
these
laudable
intentions
into
effect
be
it
therefore
resolved
that
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
wisdom
of
congress
whether
it
would
not
be
an
act
of
charity
to
grant
us
a
small
portion
of
their
territory
either
on
the
missouri
river
or
any
place
that
may
seem
to
them
most
conducive
to
the
public
good
and
our
future
welfare
subject
however
to
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
government
of
the
united
states
may
think
proper
to
adopt
bowler
chairman
craw
secretary
ao
is
a
diabolical
pursuit
which
a
great
part
of
our
christian
community
are
engaged
in
now
brethren
i
need
not
enlarge
on
this
point
you
that
have
been
observing
have
already
seen
the
trap
under
the
bait
and
although
some
of
our
population
have
been
foolish
enough
to
sell
their
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
yet
i
doubt
whether
the
colonization
society
will
entrap
many
more
it
is
too
and
contrary
to
all
reason
to
suppose
that
there
is
any
good
design
in
this
project
if
they
are
willing
to
restore
for
what
they
have
taken
by
false
accusation
they
can
do
it
to
better
advantage
in
the
bosom
of
our
country
than
at
several
thousand
miles
off
how
would
you
do
brethren
if
your
object
was
really
to
benefit
the
poor
would
you
send
them
into
a
neighboring
forest
and
there
deal
out
that
food
which
they
were
famishing
for
now
we
stand
different
from
beggars
our
ancestors
were
stolen
property
and
property
which
belonged
to
god
this
is
well
known
by
our
religious
community
and
they
find
that
the
owner
is
about
to
detect
them
now
if
they
can
slip
away
the
stolen
goods
by
smuggling
all
those
out
of
the
country
which
god
would
be
likely
to
make
an
instrument
of
in
bringing
them
to
justice
and
keep
the
rest
in
ignorance
by
such
means
things
would
go
on
well
with
them
and
they
would
appease
their
consciences
by
telling
what
great
things
they
are
doing
for
the
colored
population
and
god
cause
but
we
understand
better
how
it
is
the
deception
is
not
so
well
practised
but
that
we
can
discover
the
mark
of
the
beast
they
will
steal
the
sons
of
africa
bring
them
to
america
keep
them
and
their
posterity
in
bondage
for
centuries
letting
them
have
what
education
they
can
pick
up
of
themselves
then
transport
them
back
to
africa
by
which
means
america
gets
all
her
drudgery
done
at
little
expense
and
endeavors
to
flatter
the
deity
by
making
him
a
sacrifice
of
good
works
of
this
kind
but
to
the
awful
disappointment
of
all
such
blasphemers
they
will
meet
the
justice
of
god
which
will
be
to
them
a
devouring
sword
ap
delivered
from
the
fetters
of
slavery
we
are
oppressed
by
an
unreasonable
unrighteous
and
cruel
prejudice
which
aims
at
nothing
less
than
the
forcing
away
of
all
the
free
colored
population
of
the
united
states
to
the
distant
shores
of
africa
far
be
it
from
me
to
impeach
the
motives
of
every
member
of
the
american
colonization
society
the
civilizing
and
christianizing
of
that
vast
continent
and
the
extirpation
of
the
abominable
traffic
in
slaves
which
notwithstanding
all
the
laws
passed
for
its
suppression
is
still
carried
on
in
all
its
horrors
are
no
doubt
the
principal
motives
which
induce
many
to
give
it
their
support
there
are
those
and
those
who
are
most
active
and
influential
in
this
cause
who
hesitate
not
to
say
that
they
wish
to
rid
the
country
of
the
free
colored
population
and
there
is
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
with
many
this
is
the
principal
motive
for
supporting
that
society
and
that
whether
africa
is
civilized
or
not
and
whether
the
be
suppressed
or
not
they
would
wish
to
see
the
free
colored
people
removed
from
this
country
to
africa
could
certainly
be
brought
into
a
state
of
civil
and
religious
improvement
without
sending
all
the
free
people
of
color
in
the
united
states
there
few
missionaries
properly
fitted
out
and
supported
would
do
more
for
the
instruction
and
improvement
of
the
natives
of
that
country
than
a
host
of
colonists
the
greater
part
of
whom
would
need
to
be
instructed
themselves
and
all
of
whom
for
a
long
period
would
find
enough
to
do
to
provide
for
themselves
instead
of
instructing
the
natives
inconsistent
are
those
who
say
that
africa
will
be
benefitted
by
the
removal
of
the
free
people
of
color
of
the
united
states
there
while
they
say
they
are
the
vile
and
people
in
the
world
if
we
are
as
vile
and
degraded
as
they
represent
us
and
they
wish
the
africans
to
be
rendered
a
virtuous
enlightened
and
happy
people
they
should
not
of
sending
among
them
lest
we
should
make
them
worse
instead
of
better
colonies
planted
by
white
men
on
the
shores
of
america
so
far
from
benefitting
the
aborigines
corrupted
their
morals
and
caused
their
ruin
and
yet
those
who
say
are
the
most
vile
people
in
the
world
would
send
us
to
africa
to
improve
the
character
and
condition
of
the
natives
such
arguments
would
not
be
listened
to
for
a
moment
were
not
the
minds
of
the
community
strangely
warped
by
prejudice
who
wish
that
that
vast
continent
should
be
for
the
injuries
done
it
by
sending
thither
the
light
of
the
gospel
and
the
arts
of
civilized
life
should
aid
in
sending
and
supporting
well
qualified
missionaries
who
should
be
wholly
devoted
to
the
work
of
instruction
instead
of
sending
colonists
who
would
be
apt
to
turn
the
ignorance
of
the
natives
to
their
own
advantage
and
do
them
more
harm
than
good
has
also
been
said
by
colonizationists
about
improving
the
character
and
condition
of
the
people
of
color
of
this
country
by
sending
them
to
africa
this
is
more
inconsistent
still
we
are
to
be
improved
by
being
sent
far
from
civilized
society
this
is
a
novel
mode
of
improvement
what
is
there
in
the
burning
sun
the
arid
plains
and
barbarous
customs
of
africa
that
is
so
peculiarly
favorable
to
our
improvement
what
hinders
our
improving
here
where
schools
and
colleges
abound
where
the
gospel
is
preached
at
every
corner
and
where
all
the
arts
and
sciences
are
verging
fast
to
perfection
nothing
nothing
but
prejudice
it
requires
no
large
expenditures
no
hazardous
enterprises
to
raise
the
people
of
color
in
the
united
states
to
as
highly
improved
a
state
as
any
class
of
the
community
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
those
who
profess
to
be
anxious
for
it
should
lay
aside
their
prejudices
and
act
towards
them
as
they
do
by
others
are
natives
of
this
country
we
ask
only
to
be
treated
as
well
as
foreigners
not
a
few
of
our
fathers
suffered
and
bled
to
purchase
its
independence
we
ask
only
to
be
treated
as
well
as
those
who
fought
against
it
we
have
toiled
to
cultivate
it
and
to
raise
it
to
its
present
prosperous
condition
we
ask
only
to
share
equal
privileges
with
those
who
come
from
distant
lands
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
our
labor
let
these
moderate
requests
be
granted
and
we
need
not
go
to
africa
nor
any
where
else
to
be
improved
and
happy
we
can
not
but
doubt
the
purity
of
the
motives
of
those
persons
who
deny
us
these
requests
and
would
send
us
to
africa
to
gain
what
they
might
give
us
at
home
they
say
the
prejudices
of
the
country
against
us
are
invincible
and
as
they
can
not
be
conquered
it
is
better
that
we
should
be
removed
beyond
their
influence
this
plea
should
never
proceed
from
the
lips
of
any
man
who
professes
to
believe
that
a
just
god
rules
in
the
heavens
american
colonization
society
is
a
numerous
and
influential
body
would
they
lay
aside
their
prejudices
much
of
the
burden
would
be
at
once
removed
and
their
example
especially
if
they
were
as
anxious
to
have
done
us
as
to
send
us
to
africa
would
have
such
an
influence
upon
the
community
at
large
as
would
soon
cause
prejudice
to
hide
its
deformed
head
alas
the
course
which
they
have
pursued
has
an
opposite
tendency
by
the
which
they
are
continually
giving
of
our
character
and
conduct
we
have
sustained
much
injury
and
have
reason
to
apprehend
much
more
any
charge
of
crime
we
have
been
denied
all
access
to
places
to
which
we
formerly
had
the
most
free
intercourse
the
colored
citizens
of
other
places
on
leaving
their
homes
have
been
denied
the
privilege
of
returning
and
others
have
been
absolutely
driven
out
the
colonization
society
had
no
effect
in
producing
these
barbarous
measures
profess
to
have
no
other
object
in
view
than
the
colonizing
of
the
free
people
of
color
on
the
coast
of
africa
with
their
but
if
our
homes
are
made
so
uncomfortable
that
we
can
not
continue
in
them
or
if
like
our
brethren
of
ohio
and
new
orleans
we
are
driven
from
them
and
no
other
door
is
open
to
receive
us
but
africa
our
removal
there
will
be
any
thing
but
voluntary
is
very
certain
that
very
few
free
people
of
color
to
go
to
that
the
colonization
society
this
and
yet
they
do
certainly
calculate
that
in
time
they
will
have
us
all
removed
there
can
this
be
effected
but
by
making
our
situation
worse
here
and
closing
every
other
door
against
us
aq
attention
was
forcibly
attracted
by
a
communication
in
mr
poulson
daily
advertiser
of
the
inst
which
states
that
mrs
stansbury
of
trenton
has
presented
thousand
to
the
colonization
society
now
i
think
it
is
greatly
to
be
regretted
that
this
highly
generous
and
benevolent
lady
has
been
induced
to
make
this
donation
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
some
of
the
superannuated
slaves
to
africa
when
objects
of
much
greater
importance
could
be
attained
by
offering
a
premium
to
master
mechanics
to
take
colored
children
as
apprentices
so
that
they
would
become
useful
to
themselves
and
others
it
is
an
inquiry
becoming
of
the
utmost
importance
what
is
to
become
of
those
children
who
are
arriving
at
the
age
of
manhood
am
greatly
astonished
that
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
should
take
so
active
a
part
in
endeavoring
to
convey
the
freemen
of
color
to
africa
even
in
boston
and
they
have
taken
the
lead
in
support
of
this
object
they
can
not
be
aware
of
the
great
injury
they
will
be
the
means
of
inflicting
on
us
instead
of
doing
this
they
should
endeavor
to
remove
prejudice
to
ameliorate
and
improve
the
condition
of
the
colored
people
by
education
and
by
having
their
children
placed
in
a
situation
to
learn
a
trade
i
hope
through
the
assistance
of
divine
providence
that
the
liberator
may
be
the
means
especially
in
boston
the
cradle
of
liberty
and
independence
of
guiding
the
people
of
this
country
in
the
path
which
equal
justice
and
the
public
good
so
evidently
indicate
have
never
conversed
with
an
intelligent
man
of
color
not
swayed
by
interested
and
sinister
motives
who
was
not
decidedly
opposed
to
leaving
his
home
for
the
fatal
clime
of
africa
i
am
well
acquainted
with
all
the
masters
of
vessels
belonging
to
this
port
who
have
been
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
they
all
agree
in
representing
it
as
one
of
the
most
unhealthy
countries
in
the
latitude
of
in
the
months
of
june
and
july
the
thermometer
is
at
from
to
degrees
what
must
it
be
then
in
the
latitude
of
or
under
a
vertical
sun
and
where
after
the
rainy
season
the
effluvium
which
arises
from
the
putrefaction
of
vegetables
is
productive
of
the
most
fatal
effects
sir
james
yeo
agrees
with
their
account
in
his
statement
laid
before
the
admiralty
of
great
britain
any
one
in
either
of
our
southern
states
given
any
thing
like
a
thousand
dollars
to
promote
emigration
to
africa
not
one
has
shown
so
much
compassion
for
the
oppressed
slave
general
mercer
who
is
i
believe
the
president
of
the
colonization
society
promised
to
emancipate
his
slaves
and
to
sell
his
large
possessions
in
virginia
and
to
remove
with
them
to
africa
my
friends
inform
me
and
i
believe
him
to
be
one
of
the
most
humane
and
best
of
masters
mr
key
the
great
advocate
and
the
late
judge
washington
promised
to
liberate
their
slaves
i
believe
that
neither
of
them
has
performed
his
promise
to
a
statement
made
by
mr
key
they
have
removed
in
fourteen
years
about
as
many
hundred
emigrants
i
will
venture
to
say
that
at
least
a
half
million
have
been
born
during
the
same
period
we
ask
not
their
compassion
and
aid
in
assisting
us
to
emigrate
to
africa
we
are
contented
in
the
land
that
gave
us
birth
and
for
which
many
of
our
fathers
fought
and
died
during
the
war
which
established
our
independence
i
well
remember
that
when
the
new
england
regiment
marched
through
this
city
on
their
way
to
attack
the
english
army
under
the
command
of
lord
cornwallis
there
were
several
companies
of
colored
people
as
brave
men
as
ever
fought
and
i
saw
those
brave
soldiers
who
fought
at
the
battle
of
red
bank
under
green
where
count
donop
the
commander
was
killed
and
the
hessians
defeated
all
this
appears
to
be
forgotten
now
and
the
descendants
of
these
men
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
the
part
they
took
in
the
struggle
for
independence
are
intended
to
be
removed
to
a
distant
and
inhospitable
country
while
the
emigrants
from
every
other
country
are
permitted
to
seek
an
asylum
here
from
oppression
and
to
enjoy
the
blessings
of
both
civil
and
religious
liberty
equally
with
those
who
are
entitled
to
it
by
birthright
think
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
might
do
much
towards
destroying
the
domestic
slave
trade
which
breaks
asunder
the
sacred
ties
of
husband
wife
and
children
not
a
voice
is
raised
by
them
against
this
most
cruel
injustice
in
the
british
colonies
this
is
not
permitted
yet
it
exists
in
the
only
true
republic
on
earth
ar
friends
and
i
trust
by
this
time
you
have
known
well
my
sentiments
in
relation
to
the
american
colonization
society
and
the
great
objects
which
have
been
set
forth
of
a
general
union
of
interest
in
funds
and
education
for
the
permanent
establishment
and
furtherance
of
our
prosperity
in
this
our
native
country
addition
to
what
has
been
already
said
on
the
subject
i
shall
briefly
set
forth
some
of
the
leading
causes
of
our
wretchedness
and
misery
and
the
prominent
motives
of
the
colonization
society
in
sending
us
away
much
theory
has
been
used
in
the
discussions
upon
our
civil
and
political
situation
in
this
country
we
have
been
branded
in
many
instances
may
i
not
say
in
the
highest
courts
of
the
nation
courts
of
justice
and
equity
in
public
and
family
circles
as
being
an
inferior
race
of
beings
not
possessing
like
intellect
and
faculty
with
the
whites
we
are
represented
as
being
incapable
of
acting
for
ourselves
consequently
not
educated
and
qualified
to
be
admitted
into
public
places
to
vindicate
the
integrity
of
our
race
and
the
qualifications
we
are
capable
of
acquiring
many
of
our
noble
statesmen
orators
and
lawyers
have
made
our
capital
ring
with
the
empty
sound
of
inferiority
degradation
the
impossibility
of
tolerating
equality
with
the
blacks
sacred
writ
has
been
carefully
examined
by
these
gentlemen
of
science
and
construed
to
suit
their
narrow
consciences
prophets
have
arisen
among
them
who
hold
forth
to
the
people
the
continuation
of
our
political
thraldom
unless
there
be
a
general
removal
of
all
the
free
among
us
to
the
coast
of
africa
others
argue
that
although
they
have
good
feelings
towards
us
and
would
do
any
thing
for
us
if
we
were
out
of
their
sight
and
out
of
the
hearing
of
their
slaves
yet
to
admit
us
into
their
circles
would
be
to
pervert
the
present
order
of
society
and
the
happiness
of
the
good
white
citizens
of
the
country
these
are
generally
bible
men
such
as
hold
forth
the
true
oracles
of
god
yet
deny
him
in
their
actions
and
words
the
supreme
control
over
all
his
creatures
there
is
hardly
ever
an
action
performed
whether
good
or
bad
but
there
is
generally
a
reason
given
for
so
doing
and
he
is
a
wicked
daring
character
who
can
not
find
a
cloak
at
any
time
to
cover
his
hideous
crimes
the
men
who
have
been
foremost
in
withholding
from
us
our
dearest
and
most
sacred
rights
have
always
held
out
false
colors
to
the
community
at
large
such
as
inferiority
degradation
nuisance
pest
slaves
species
of
monkey
apes
to
justify
their
inhuman
and
unchristian
acts
towards
us
and
to
deaden
the
severe
pangs
of
conscience
that
harass
them
they
would
wish
to
appear
innocent
before
the
world
as
doing
unto
all
men
as
they
would
they
should
do
unto
them
do
they
base
their
objects
in
full
upon
such
frivolous
excuses
as
these
no
the
truth
is
actions
speak
louder
than
words
it
is
my
candid
opinion
there
would
have
been
no
colonization
society
formed
for
our
transportation
to
the
western
coast
of
africa
had
there
been
no
free
colored
people
and
did
not
our
numbers
increase
daily
if
we
as
a
free
body
of
people
had
remained
in
the
same
character
with
slaves
monkeys
and
baboons
there
would
not
have
been
so
much
excitement
in
the
community
about
us
but
as
they
see
by
our
improvement
a
great
improvement
indeed
within
forty
years
that
the
period
is
hastening
on
there
will
be
no
other
alternative
but
we
must
rank
among
them
in
civilization
science
and
politics
they
have
got
up
this
colonization
scheme
to
persuade
us
to
leave
our
slave
brethren
and
flee
to
the
pestilential
shores
of
africa
where
we
shall
be
in
danger
of
being
forced
to
hang
our
harps
upon
the
willows
and
our
song
of
liberty
and
civilization
will
be
hushed
by
the
impelling
force
of
barbarian
despots
as
in
pursuit
of
this
great
object
the
elevation
of
the
people
of
color
various
ways
and
means
have
been
resorted
to
among
others
the
american
colonization
society
is
the
most
prominent
not
doubting
the
sincerity
of
many
friends
who
are
engaged
in
that
cause
yet
we
beg
leave
to
say
that
it
does
not
meet
with
our
approbation
however
great
the
debt
which
these
united
states
may
owe
to
injured
africa
and
however
unjustly
her
sons
have
been
made
to
bleed
and
her
daughters
to
drink
of
the
cup
of
affliction
still
we
who
have
been
born
and
nurtured
on
this
soil
we
whose
habits
manners
and
customs
are
the
same
in
common
with
other
americans
can
never
consent
to
take
our
lives
in
our
hands
and
be
the
bearers
of
the
redress
offered
by
that
society
to
that
much
afflicted
country
it
not
to
barbarians
lest
they
refuse
to
be
civilized
and
eject
our
christian
missionaries
from
among
them
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
of
the
christian
era
laws
have
been
enacted
in
some
of
the
states
of
this
great
republic
to
compel
an
unprotected
and
harmless
portion
of
our
brethren
to
leave
their
homes
and
seek
an
asylum
in
foreign
climes
and
in
taking
a
view
of
the
unhappy
situation
of
many
of
these
whom
the
oppressive
laws
alluded
to
continually
crowd
into
the
atlantic
cities
dependent
for
their
support
upon
their
daily
labor
and
who
often
suffer
for
want
of
employment
we
have
had
to
lament
that
no
means
have
yet
been
devised
for
their
relief
at
convention
has
not
been
unmindful
of
the
operations
of
the
american
colonization
society
and
it
would
respectfully
suggest
to
that
august
body
of
learning
talent
and
worth
that
in
our
humble
opinion
strengthened
too
by
the
opinions
of
eminent
men
in
this
country
as
well
as
in
europe
that
they
are
pursuing
the
direct
road
to
perpetuate
slavery
with
all
its
unchristianlike
concomitants
in
this
boasted
land
of
freedom
and
as
citizens
and
men
whose
best
blood
is
sapped
to
gain
popularity
for
that
institution
we
would
in
the
most
feeling
manner
beg
of
them
to
desist
or
if
we
must
be
sacrificed
to
their
philanthropy
we
would
rather
die
at
home
many
of
our
fathers
and
some
of
us
have
fought
and
bled
for
the
liberty
independence
and
peace
which
you
now
enjoy
and
surely
it
would
be
ungenerous
and
unfeeling
in
you
to
deny
us
a
humble
and
quiet
grave
in
that
country
which
gave
us
birth
au
upon
the
whole
my
view
of
the
operations
of
the
colonization
society
in
relieving
the
slave
states
of
the
evil
which
weighs
them
down
more
than
a
hundred
tariffs
is
illustrated
by
an
old
fable
in
which
it
is
stated
that
a
man
was
seen
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
scraping
away
the
dust
with
his
foot
one
passing
by
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
i
wish
to
remove
this
mountain
said
he
you
fool
replied
the
other
you
can
never
do
it
in
that
way
well
said
he
i
can
raise
a
dust
ca
i
i
do
not
wish
to
censure
the
motives
of
this
society
but
surely
they
are
visionary
its
supporters
are
bewildered
in
their
own
dust
which
is
well
calculated
to
injure
the
vision
of
good
men
the
commercial
advertiser
says
they
do
indeed
wish
to
wipe
away
from
the
national
records
the
stain
of
slavery
but
hope
it
may
be
accomplished
as
the
virginia
enquirer
has
it
surely
but
quietly
yes
sir
and
quietly
enough
ambition
leads
not
to
superiority
but
to
our
and
this
we
ask
no
more
if
the
places
in
which
we
dwell
are
too
straight
for
us
and
the
white
population
place
us
in
a
state
far
to
the
west
take
us
into
the
union
give
us
our
as
let
the
southern
states
make
all
born
after
a
date
not
two
years
distant
free
and
let
the
colonization
society
turn
its
attention
and
energies
to
the
removing
of
liberated
slaves
there
the
free
people
will
go
without
their
aid
but
if
the
government
is
fearful
of
retaliation
it
may
allay
its
fears
by
a
consideration
of
the
fact
of
there
not
being
one
freeman
engaged
in
the
late
insurrections
of
freemen
informing
against
slaves
the
peaceable
manner
in
which
we
live
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
south
and
throughout
the
whole
union
the
meetings
that
have
lately
been
held
and
resolutions
passed
expressive
of
our
disapprobation
of
such
measures
may
all
show
that
such
fears
are
groundless
i
repeat
again
us
our
rights
we
ask
no
more
sir
if
i
possessed
the
indies
i
would
pledge
the
whole
that
if
such
measures
were
taken
and
such
grants
made
no
retaliation
would
be
made
by
us
as
a
body
for
former
evils
av
no
age
of
our
existence
have
there
been
more
pains
taken
by
priests
and
people
in
public
and
private
in
church
and
state
to
give
them
currency
than
at
present
the
whole
theme
of
that
wicked
persecuting
combination
the
colonization
society
is
calculated
to
impress
upon
the
mind
of
the
public
these
atrocious
maxims
which
every
day
strengthen
a
prejudice
not
only
cherished
by
the
whites
against
the
blacks
but
by
the
blacks
against
the
whites
that
foul
fiend
of
hell
that
destroying
angel
who
hath
power
to
take
peace
from
the
earth
and
to
kill
with
the
sword
is
gaining
a
commanding
influence
very
fast
over
both
parties
and
who
but
the
advocates
of
the
colonization
society
receive
him
as
a
welcome
guest
who
but
they
have
built
him
a
temple
and
cried
long
live
prejudice
against
free
born
americans
of
sable
hue
who
but
they
are
continually
crying
the
free
blacks
are
dangerous
the
free
blacks
are
dangerous
away
with
them
away
with
them
to
africa
who
but
they
are
the
apologists
for
murder
theft
and
all
the
horrid
concomitants
of
slavery
who
but
they
have
defiled
our
temples
of
worship
dedicated
to
god
for
his
service
making
merchandise
of
the
souls
of
men
by
transferring
them
over
to
the
keeping
of
prejudice
aw
other
extracts
might
be
recorded
but
these
must
suffice
i
have
given
the
sentiments
of
the
people
of
color
as
expressed
individually
in
public
orations
in
conventions
of
delegates
and
in
popular
assemblies
their
proceedings
evince
a
keen
discrimination
between
true
and
false
philanthropy
and
an
intellectual
ability
successfully
to
defend
their
cause
their
instincts
are
more
than
a
match
for
the
specious
sophistry
and
learned
sense
of
colonizationists
they
meet
them
on
every
point
and
on
every
point
achieve
a
victory
conscious
of
the
fact
that
in
their
complexion
is
found
the
only
motive
for
their
banishment
they
clearly
illustrate
the
hypocrisy
and
injustice
of
the
african
crusade
their
union
of
purpose
is
such
as
can
not
be
broken
how
intense
is
their
love
of
country
how
remarkable
their
patient
endurance
of
wrongs
how
strong
their
abhorrence
of
expatriation
how
auspicious
the
talents
which
they
display
every
humane
and
honorable
man
will
assent
to
the
proposition
that
no
scheme
for
the
removal
of
a
numerous
people
from
one
continent
to
another
ought
to
be
prosecuted
contrary
to
their
desires
a
scheme
can
not
be
benevolent
which
thrives
upon
persecution
benevolent
oppression
is
a
solecism
another
truth
is
that
no
such
removal
can
be
effected
merely
by
the
presentation
of
selfish
inducements
or
without
resorting
to
coercive
measures
to
show
that
coercion
is
openly
advocated
by
some
of
the
prominent
supporters
of
the
colonization
society
i
make
the
following
extracts
from
the
speeches
of
messrs
broadnax
and
fisher
delivered
during
the
debate
in
the
virginia
house
of
delegates
a
short
time
since
mr
broadnax
said
is
idle
to
talk
about
not
resorting
to
force
every
body
must
look
to
the
introduction
of
force
of
some
kind
or
other
and
it
is
in
truth
a
question
of
expediency
of
moral
justice
of
political
good
faith
whether
we
shall
fairly
delineate
our
whole
system
on
the
face
of
the
bill
or
leave
the
acquisition
of
extorted
consent
to
other
processes
the
real
question
the
only
question
of
magnitude
to
be
settled
is
the
great
preliminary
question
do
you
intend
to
send
the
free
persons
of
color
out
of
virginia
or
not
the
free
negroes
are
willing
to
go
they
will
go
if
not
willing
they
must
be
compelled
to
go
some
gentlemen
think
it
politic
not
now
to
insert
this
feature
in
the
bill
though
they
proclaim
their
readiness
to
resort
to
it
when
it
becomes
necessary
they
think
that
for
a
year
or
two
a
sufficient
number
will
consent
to
go
and
then
the
rest
can
be
compelled
for
my
part
i
deem
it
better
to
approach
the
question
and
settle
it
at
once
and
avow
it
openly
the
intelligent
portion
of
the
free
negroes
know
very
well
what
is
going
will
they
not
see
your
debates
they
not
see
that
coercion
is
ultimately
to
be
resorted
to
they
will
perceive
that
the
edict
has
gone
forth
and
that
it
must
fall
if
not
now
in
a
short
time
upon
them
have
already
expressed
it
as
my
opinion
that
few
very
few
will
consent
to
emigrate
if
no
compulsory
measure
be
with
it
many
in
anticipation
of
its
sure
and
certain
arrival
will
in
the
mean
time
go
away
they
will
be
sensible
that
the
time
would
come
when
they
would
be
forced
to
leave
the
state
without
it
you
will
still
no
doubt
have
applicants
for
removal
equal
to
your
means
yes
sir
people
who
will
not
only
consent
but
beg
you
to
deport
them
but
what
sort
of
a
consent
extorted
by
a
series
of
oppression
calculated
to
render
their
situation
among
us
insupportable
many
of
those
who
have
already
been
sent
off
went
with
avowed
but
under
the
influence
of
a
more
decided
compulsion
than
any
which
this
bill
holds
out
i
will
not
express
in
its
full
extent
the
idea
i
entertain
of
what
has
been
done
or
what
enormities
will
be
perpetrated
to
induce
this
class
of
persons
to
leave
the
state
who
does
not
know
that
when
a
free
negro
by
crime
or
otherwise
has
rendered
himself
obnoxious
to
a
neighborhood
how
easy
it
is
for
a
party
to
visit
him
one
night
take
him
from
his
bed
and
family
and
apply
to
him
the
gentle
admonition
of
a
severe
flagellation
to
induce
him
to
to
go
away
in
a
few
nights
the
dose
can
be
repeated
perhaps
increased
until
in
the
language
of
the
physicians
has
been
administered
to
produce
the
desired
operation
and
the
fellow
then
becomes
to
move
away
i
have
certainly
heard
if
incorrectly
the
gentleman
from
southampton
will
put
me
right
that
of
the
large
cargo
of
emigrants
lately
transported
from
that
country
to
liberia
all
of
whom
to
be
to
go
were
rendered
so
by
some
such
severe
ministrations
as
those
i
have
described
a
lynch
club
a
committee
of
vigilance
could
easily
exercise
a
kind
of
inquisitorial
over
any
neighborhood
and
convert
any
desired
number
i
have
no
doubt
at
any
time
into
a
willingness
to
be
removed
but
who
really
prefers
such
means
as
these
to
the
course
proposed
in
this
bill
and
one
or
the
other
is
inevitable
for
no
matter
how
you
change
this
bill
sooner
or
later
the
free
negroes
will
be
to
leave
the
state
indeed
sir
all
of
us
look
to
force
of
some
kind
or
other
direct
or
indirect
moral
or
physical
legal
or
illegal
many
who
are
opposed
they
say
to
any
compulsory
feature
in
the
bill
desire
to
introduce
such
severe
regulations
into
our
police
laws
such
restrictions
of
their
existing
privileges
such
inability
to
hold
property
obtain
employment
rent
residences
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
remain
amongst
us
not
this
force
mr
fisher
said
we
wait
until
the
free
negroes
consent
to
leave
the
state
we
shall
wait
until
time
is
no
more
never
will
give
their
and
if
the
house
amend
the
bill
as
proposed
their
consent
is
in
a
manner
pointed
out
by
the
gentleman
from
dinwiddie
and
it
is
a
great
question
whether
we
shall
force
the
people
to
extort
their
consent
from
them
in
this
he
believed
if
the
compulsory
principle
were
stricken
out
this
class
of
people
would
be
forced
to
leave
by
the
harsh
treatment
of
the
whites
the
people
in
those
parts
of
the
state
where
they
most
abound
were
determined
as
far
as
they
could
learn
through
the
newspapers
and
other
sources
to
get
rid
of
the
blacks
what
a
revelation
what
a
confession
is
here
the
free
blacks
taken
from
their
beds
and
severely
flagellated
to
make
them
willing
to
emigrate
and
legislative
compulsion
openly
advocated
to
accomplish
this
nefarious
project
yes
the
gentlemen
say
truly
very
few
will
consent
to
emigrate
never
will
give
their
consent
and
therefore
they
must
be
expelled
by
force
it
is
true
the
bill
proposed
by
mr
broadnax
was
rejected
by
a
small
majority
but
it
serves
to
illustrate
the
spirit
of
the
colonization
leaders
the
editor
of
the
lynchburg
virginian
an
advocate
of
the
society
uses
the
following
language
if
they
will
not
consider
for
themselves
we
consider
for
the
safety
of
the
people
is
the
supreme
law
and
to
that
law
all
minor
considerations
must
bend
if
the
free
negroes
will
not
emigrate
must
be
contented
to
endure
those
privations
which
the
public
interest
and
safety
call
in
the
last
richmond
enquirer
we
notice
an
advertisement
setting
forth
that
a
petition
will
be
presented
to
the
next
legislature
of
virginia
from
the
county
of
westmoreland
praying
the
passage
of
some
law
to
the
free
negroes
in
this
commonwealth
to
emigrate
therefrom
under
a
penalty
which
will
effectually
promote
this
object
so
too
at
a
meeting
of
the
citizens
of
prince
george
county
in
maryland
it
was
resolved
to
petition
the
next
legislature
to
remove
all
the
free
negroes
out
of
that
state
and
to
prohibit
all
persons
from
manumitting
slaves
without
making
provision
for
their
removal
i
close
this
work
with
a
specimen
of
the
sophistry
which
is
used
to
give
to
the
american
colonization
society
in
the
month
of
june
i
happened
to
peruse
a
number
of
the
southern
religious
telegraph
in
which
i
found
an
essay
enforcing
the
duty
of
clergymen
to
take
up
collections
in
aid
of
the
funds
of
the
colonization
society
on
the
then
approaching
fourth
of
july
after
an
appropriate
introductory
paragraph
the
writer
proceeds
in
the
following
remarkable
strain
we
have
a
plea
like
a
peace
offering
to
man
and
to
god
we
answer
poor
blinded
africa
in
her
complaint
that
we
have
her
children
and
that
they
have
served
on
our
plantations
and
we
tell
her
look
at
their
returning
we
took
them
barbarous
though
measurably
free
untaught
rude
without
science
without
the
true
religion
without
philosophy
and
strangers
to
the
best
civil
governments
and
now
we
return
them
to
her
bosom
the
mechanical
with
civilization
with
republican
feelings
and
above
all
with
the
true
knowledge
of
the
true
god
and
the
way
of
salvation
through
the
redeemer
mechanical
arts
with
whom
did
they
serve
an
apprenticeship
philosophy
in
what
colleges
were
they
taught
it
is
strange
that
we
should
be
so
anxious
to
get
rid
of
these
scientific
men
of
color
these
philosophers
these
republicans
these
christians
and
that
we
should
shun
their
company
as
if
they
were
afflicted
with
the
hydrophobia
or
carried
a
deadly
pestilence
in
their
train
certainly
they
have
singular
notions
of
the
christian
religion
which
tolerates
or
rather
which
is
so
perverted
as
to
tolerate
the
oppression
of
god
rational
creatures
by
its
professors
they
must
feel
a
peculiar
kind
of
brotherly
love
for
those
who
banded
together
to
remove
them
to
africa
because
they
were
too
proud
to
associate
familiarly
with
men
of
a
sable
complexion
but
the
writer
proceeds
tell
her
look
at
the
little
colony
on
her
shores
we
tell
her
look
to
the
consequences
that
must
flow
to
all
her
borders
from
religion
and
science
and
knowledge
and
civilization
and
republican
government
and
then
we
ask
her
not
one
ship
load
of
emigrants
returning
with
these
multiplied
blessings
worth
more
to
her
than
a
million
of
her
barbarous
sons
so
every
ship
load
of
ignorant
and
helpless
emigrants
is
to
more
than
compensate
africa
for
every
million
of
her
children
who
have
been
kidnapped
buried
in
the
ocean
and
on
the
land
tortured
with
savage
cruelty
and
held
in
perpetual
servitude
truly
this
is
a
compendious
method
of
balancing
accounts
in
the
sight
of
god
of
africa
and
of
the
world
we
are
consequently
blameless
and
rather
praiseworthy
for
our
past
transgressions
it
is
such
sophistry
as
is
contained
in
the
foregoing
extract
that
kindles
my
indignation
into
a
blaze
i
abhor
cant
i
abhor
hypocrisy
and
if
some
of
the
advocates
of
the
colonization
society
do
not
deal
largely
in
both
i
am
unable
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
these
terms
of
the
whole
number
of
individuals
constituting
the
officers
of
the
society
nearly
i
believe
the
owners
of
or
interested
in
slave
property
not
one
of
whom
to
my
knowledge
has
emancipated
any
of
his
slaves
to
be
sent
to
liberia
the
president
of
the
society
charles
carroll
owns
i
have
understood
nearly
thousand
and
yet
he
is
lauded
beyond
measure
as
a
patriot
a
philanthropist
and
a
christian
the
former
president
judge
bushrod
washington
so
far
from
breaking
the
fetters
of
his
slaves
actually
while
holding
his
office
offered
a
large
reward
for
a
runaway
female
slave
to
any
person
who
would
secure
her
by
putting
her
into
any
jail
within
the
united
states
what
a
mockery
it
is
for
such
persons
to
profess
to
deplore
the
existence
of
slavery
or
to
denounce
the
foreign
slave
trade
for
they
neither
cease
from
their
own
oppressive
acts
nor
act
much
more
honestly
than
the
slave
dealers
the
latter
stealing
those
who
are
born
on
the
coast
of
africa
and

former

who
are
